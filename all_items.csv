0,Secretive yet accountable: Formal and informal accountability in the Australian Intelligence Community,Thesis,http://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=handle%5C%3A1885%5C%2F282269,"This research explores different types of accountability within the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC), including democratic, constitutional, learning and reputational accountability. Accountability practices in the intelligence sector and the relationship between accountability and official secrecy are not well understood. Yet the work, practices and impacts of Australia's intelligence agencies have been increasingly significant and visible as these secretive organisations have grown and emerged from the shadows. Accountability can be conceptualised as an important social process that involves interactions between two or more parties. With this lens, this research brings together theory and empirical data to explore who in the AIC has been accountable to whom, for what, why and when. This approach offers new insights into formal and informal accountability practices through the experiences of intelligence agencies, officers and overseers, and builds on existing studies of both accountability and national security. To address gaps in knowledge this research catalogues scholarly concepts of accountability, explores the relevance of these concepts to accountability in the AIC, and documents the development of AIC accountability processes and structures over time. Drawing and analysing data from 32 elite interviews, official documents and media reporting, interpretive case study research is used to explore accountability across three case studies. Case studies focus on three intelligence agencies: the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its evolving powers in the 2000s and 2010s, the involvement of the Australian Signals Directorate in the 2001 'Tampa affair', and the experiences of the then Office of National Assessments in the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2003 Iraq war. Types of accountability, approaches to transparency, impacts of secrecy and other potential factors in accountability are considered across cases. Control is explored as a significant but distinct counterpart to accountability. Intelligence agencies are not immune to typical or more unusual accountability challenges. But this research shows how both formal and informal types of accountability can occur. It shows how accountability can be hindered by secrecy and more common factors such as account-holders' mandates, resources and influence. The individual practices and perceptions of account-givers and account-holders are also influential due to the secrecy which surrounds intelligence. In the end, strong albeit varying types of accountability are evident, with domestic intelligence collections receiving particular scrutiny, foreign intelligence collections later attention, and less oversight of intelligence assessment functions.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VP78WZR8,February 2023,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Richard', 'lastName': 'Bolto'}]",,,author,Richard,Bolto,

2,Intelligence Analysis in the Digital Age,Book,https://www.routledge.com/Intelligence-Analysis-in-the-Digital-Age/Stenslie-Haugom-Vaage/p/book/9780367766993,"This book examines intelligence analysis in the digital age and demonstrates how intelligence has entered a new era.

While intelligence is an ancient activity, the digital age is a relatively new phenomenon. This volume uses the concept of the ""digital age"" to highlight the increased change, complexity, and pace of information that is now circulated, as new technology has reduced the time it takes to spread news to almost nothing. These factors mean that decision-makers face an increasingly challenging threat environment, which in turn increases the demand for timely, relevant, and reliable intelligence to support policymaking. In this context, the book demonstrates that intelligence places greater demands on analysis work, as the traditional intelligence cycle is no longer adequate as a process description. In the digital age, it is not enough to accumulate as much information as possible to gain a better understanding of the world. To meet customers’ needs, the intelligence process must be centred around the analysis work – which in turn has increased the demand for analysts. Assessments, not least predictions, are now just as important as revealing someone else’s secrets.

This volume will be of much interest to students of intelligence studies, security studies, and international relations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/M8DDWM9S,06 August 2021,"[{'creatorType': 'editor', 'firstName': 'Stig', 'lastName': 'Stenslie'}, {'creatorType': 'editor', 'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Haugom'}, {'creatorType': 'editor', 'firstName': 'Bright H.', 'lastName': 'Vaage'}]",Routledge,,editor,Stig,Stenslie,

5,Rise of the Mavericks: The U.S. Air Force Security Service and the Cold War,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/rise-mavericks,"Rise of the Mavericks traces the beginnings and subsequent development of the U.S. Air Force Security Service. Established in 1948 as part of the emerging U.S. national security apparatus, this communications intelligence organization was meant to place the fledgling U.S. Air Force on a competitive footing with its Army and Navy counterparts.  As World War II ended and the Cold War began, Air Force leaders understood that an effective cryptologic capability would be crucial for maintaining and enhancing the Air Force as a strategic and decisive component of America’s national defense. Successfully deploying air-atomic strategy in the event of a future war would require reliable information on the capabilities, intentions—and potential targets—of an opposing force, in particular the Soviet Union. Communications intelligence would be a critical source of this information, and Air Force leaders were adamant that their service not remain dependent on other service structures for this capability. The Air Force Security Service rose to the occasion, quickly establishing itself as one of the preeminent communications intelligence agencies in the United States.

Rise of the Mavericks fills the gap in the military and intelligence history literature and further complicates the literature surrounding the history of the NSA, which too often ignores or hastily addresses the contributions and role of the service COMINT agencies during the early Cold War period. The book explains how Air Force Security Service personnel were viewed as mavericks by other U.S. military and government organizations. The airmen lived up to this characterization by creating and developing an independent communications intelligence capability while persistently resisting the controlling efforts of the Armed Forces Security Agency and the National Security Agency.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XP9HZ6WM,15 April 2023,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Philip C.', 'lastName': 'Shackelford'}]",U.S. Naval Institute PRess,,author,Philip C.,Shackelford,

These are a compilation of the files maintained by the Intelligence Branch of Pakistan Government on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who emerged as the sole leader of the country and became Bangabandhu (Friend of Bangladesh). For his long-standing struggle and contribution in fostering notions of Bengali nationhood that led to the independence of Bangladesh, he has been honored as the Father of the Nation.

The volumes provide records for period 1948 to 1971 and chronologically elucidate the trajectory of the various movements and political struggles that led to the formation of an independent nation state called People's Republic of Bangladesh. These include the 1952 Bengali Language Movement that catalyzed the assertion of Bengali national identity in the region and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the struggle for independence, first through massive populist and civil disobedience movements and later during the　Bangladesh Liberation War. Important events cited in the present volumes include the 1954 United Front election victory, 1966 Six Point Movement, 1968 Agartala Conspiracy Case, 1969 mass uprising, 1970 election victory and 1971 Non-Cooperation Movement among others.

These are the first ever declassified documents released by the Government of Bangladesh and will serve as an invaluable historical resource in understanding the liberation of Bangladesh.

12,Third States Sharing Military Intelligence with Ukraine,Thesis,https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=9105347&fileOId=9107799,"This essay analyzes the legality of the sharing of military intelligence by third
States with Ukraine. The analysis is made primarily with the law of neutrality
and the Charter of the United Nations in focus but also draws on the work of
legal scholars for specific insights into international law.
Details on military intelligence are rarely publicly disclosed which entails
complexities with conducting case studies. This analysis is therefore of a
general nature, although only considering the international armed conflict
between Russia and Ukraine.
The essay concludes that the intelligence sharing is illegal under the
traditional law of neutrality, i.e. as it is formulated in the Hague Conventions
of 1907, because it violates the principle of impartiality. However, it may be
legal provided that a distinctive form of the law of neutrality, called qualified
neutrality, is considered to be valid. On the contrary, it concludes that the
sharing of intelligence is legal under the UN Charter since it would be
considered a measure of collective self-defence according to Art. 51 of the
UN Charter.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NALBWLZH,September 2022,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Oskar', 'lastName': 'Jönsson'}]",,,author,Oskar,Jönsson,

15,The Declassification Engine: what history reveals about America’s top secrets,Book,https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/545793/the-declassification-engine-by-matthew-connelly/,"Before World War II, transparent government was a proud tradition in the United States. In all but the most serious of circumstances, classification, covert operations, and spying were considered deeply un-American. But after the war, the power to decide what could be kept secret proved too tempting to give up. Since then, we have radically departed from that open tradition, allowing intelligence agencies, black sites, and classified laboratories to grow unchecked. Officials insist that only secrecy can keep us safe, but its true costs have gone unacknowledged for too long.

Using the latest techniques in data science, historian Matthew Connelly analyzes a vast trove of state secrets to unearth not only what the government really does not want us to know but also why they don’t want us to know it. Culling this research and carefully examining a series of pivotal moments in recent history, from Pearl Harbor to drone warfare, Connelly sheds light on the drivers of state secrecy—especially incompetence and criminality—and how rampant overclassification makes it impossible to protect truly vital information.

What results is an astonishing study of power: of the greed it enables, of the negligence it protects, and of what we lose as citizens when our leaders cannot be held to account. A crucial examination of the self-defeating nature of secrecy and the dire state of our nation’s archives, The Declassification Engine is a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving the past so that we may secure our future.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LFJTURF8,14 February 2023,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Matthew', 'lastName': 'Connelly'}]",Pantheon,,author,Matthew,Connelly,

In doing so, it exposes the prevailing narrative of French unreliability, weakness, and communist intrigue apparent in diplomatic dispatches and intelligence reports sent to the White House as both overblown and deeply contested. Likewise, it shows that local political factions, French intelligence and government ofﬁcials, colonial ofﬁcers, and various trans-national actors in imperial outposts and in the metropole sought access to US intelligence ofﬁcials in a deliberate effort to shape US policy for their own political postwar agendas.

One of these areas is cyberspace, where all the activities are waged in this field by exploiting the advantages such as accessibility, availability, cheapness, convenience, anonymity, independence from distance and defense – attack asymmetry called cyberwarfare. Cyberwarfare is the use of cyberattacks by a state or an organization to cause harm to another state's or organization's computer information systems, computer networks and computer infrastructures in the context of warfare.

The brazen attack in central London, Markov’s public profile and the alleged use of an exotic spy gadget (a poison umbrella) made the murder one of the Cold War’s most infamous cases of political assassination. However, despite wide-spread suspicions the case formally remains open, with the British government taking only limited actions against Bulgaria, the presumed culprit. This article draws on recently declassified archival materials from the United Kingdom to provide the first historical account focusing on the British dimensions of the case. The article discusses Markov’s journey to London, his murder and the British government’s response. It argues that the limited response to Markov’s murder largely followed uncertainty regarding the identity of the assassin and culpability of the Bulgarian state, as well as the political climate in the twilight years of détente. In contrast, British authorities responded tentatively to the attack on Litvinenko in 2006 and much more decisively to the attack on Skripal in 2018. This was due to the step change in the information environment providing more actionable intelligence and increasing unwillingness to accept Russian belligerence on UK soil.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/V6H28CWH,2023-01-18,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Daniel', 'lastName': 'Salisbury'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Karl', 'lastName': 'Dewey'}]",,Contemporary British History,author,Daniel,Salisbury,

Two main theories have been advanced. First, ?means-based? theory argues attack type determines response; cyber attacks are less likely to escalate than kinetic attacks. Second, ?effects-based? theory argues an attack?s material consequences determine the likelihood of retaliation. We advance a third perspective, arguing that the covertness of an attack has the largest effect on its propensity towards escalation. We identify two characteristics of covertness that affect support for retaliation: the certainty of attribution and its timing. We use a survey experiment to assess public support for retaliation, while varying the means, effects, timing, and attribution certainty of attacks. We find no evidence for the effects-based approach, instead finding high levels of support for retaliation regardless of an attack?s scale. We find that the most significant contributor to support for retaliation is an attack?s covertness.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/94UYESJ7,2023-02-01,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Kathryn', 'lastName': 'Hedgecock'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Lauren', 'lastName': 'Sukin'}]",,Journal of Conflict Resolution,author,Kathryn,Hedgecock,

48,Why HAL 9000 is not the future of intelligence analysis: Intelligence analysis in the 21st century,Journal article,https://journals.lib.sfu.ca/index.php/jicw/article/view/2566,"Intelligence analysis is a core function of the intelligence process, and its goal is to synthesize reliable information to assist decision-makers to take a course of action toward an uncertain future. There is no escape from uncertainty, friction, and the fog of war. Since the dawn of human history, the present moment has been experienced as unpredictable, and the challenge of determining the right future through sound decisions has always existed. Investing in new technology, continually touted as the answer for analytic troubles, seems far less difficult in the short run than trying to find consensus about a long-term vision. It is easier to develop a nuclear missile, for example, than to give a universal definition of peace, and this is what the history of the XX century was all about. While intelligence analysis is still a necessary tool for decision-makers, it is unclear who or what will perform this function in the future. Though the solution cannot be only technological, the current trajectory tells a different story whereby the human analysts are removed from their central position to make way for Artificial Intelligence.

Drawing from critical intelligence studies, this article will argue that the goal of accountability is to expand legitimacy by incorporating the civil society. This requires redeveloping the scope of intelligence and its audience beyond legal norms and traditional decision-makers. To do so, the article will consider the following actors: 1) the media; 2) whistleblowers and leaks; 3) scholars; and 4) fiction writers. These actors may complement intelligence by gathering information or acting as knowledge advisory groups. Moreover, they can also challenge intelligence by promoting deeper scrutiny and transparency, while constructing archetypes that represent secret agencies. The conclusion will summarize the strengths and limitations deriving from these actors to promote accountability. It will also claim that, through a critical approach, exploring new accountability forms are necessary to expand the social legitimacy of intelligence policies.

This book examines British secret intelligence over the thirty years preceding its very public failings. From the Soviet Union to South Africa and Libya, Mark Wilkinson provides a detailed analysis and vivid account of the development and functioning of Britain's intelligence agencies in the struggle against the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Based on archival research and interviews with key players in the intelligence establishment, he shows how a handful of chemical and biological weapons experts battled to make their voices heard. They had evidence that illegal weapons development was taking place but were continually rebuffed by adversaries in Whitehall. Fascinating, surprising and sometimes shocking, Before Intelligence Failed is a compelling account of what was known about chemical and biological weapons proliferation before the Iraq War.

It argues that intelligence accountability is best understood not as an end in itself but as a means that is integral democratic governance. On the one hand, to assure the executive of government and the public that the activities of intelligence agencies are lawful and, if not, to identify breaches in compliance. On the other hand, to raise awareness of and appreciation for the intelligence function, and whether it is being carried out in the most effective, efficient, and innovative way possible to achieve its objective. The analysis shows how the addition of legislative and judicial components to executive and administrative accountability has been shaping evolving institutions, composition, practices, characteristics, and cultures of intelligence oversight and review in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand using a most-similar systems design. Democracies are engaged in an asymmetric struggle against unprincipled adversaries. Technological change is enabling unprecedented social and political disruption. These threat vectors have significantly affected, altered, and expanded the role, powers and capabilities of intelligence organizations.

68,National Intelligence and Science: Beyond the Great Divide in Analysis and Policy,Book,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/national-intelligence-and-science-9780199360864,"Intelligence is currently facing increasingly challenging cross-pressures from both a need for accurate and timely assessments of potential or imminent security threats and the unpredictability of many of these emerging threats. We are living in a social environment of growing security and intelligence challenges, yet the traditional, narrow intelligence process is becoming increasingly insufficient for coping with diffuse, complex, and rapidly-transforming threats. The essence of intelligence is no longer the collection, analysis, and dissemination of secret information, but has become instead the management of uncertainty in areas critical for overriding security goals--not only for nations, but also for the international community as a whole. For its part, scientific research on major societal risks like climate change is facing a similar cross-pressure from demand on the one hand and incomplete data and developing theoretical concepts on the other. For both of these knowledge-producing domains, the common denominator is the paramount challenges of framing and communicating uncertainty and of managing the pitfalls of politicization.

National Intelligence and Science is one of the first attempts to analyze these converging domains and the implications of their convergence, in terms of both more scientific approaches to intelligence problems and intelligence approaches to scientific problems. Science and intelligence constitute, as the book spells out, two remarkably similar and interlinked domains of knowledge production, yet ones that remain traditionally separated by a deep political, cultural, and epistemological divide.

Looking ahead, the two twentieth-century monoliths--the scientific and the intelligence estates--are becoming simply outdated in their traditional form. The risk society is closing the divide, though in a direction not foreseen by the proponents of turning intelligence analysis into a science, or the new production of scientific knowledge.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YHPHHLPX,2015-01-02,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Wilhelm', 'lastName': 'Agrell'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Gregory F.', 'lastName': 'Treverton'}]",Oxford University Press,,author,Wilhelm,Agrell,

After distinguished service as artillery officer and aide-de-camp to General Haig during the First World War, Morton worked for the Secret Intelligence Service from 1919-1934, and the fortunes of SIS in the interwar years are described here in unprecedented detail. As Director of the Industrial Intelligence Centre in the 1930s, Morton’s warnings of Germany’s military and industrial preparations for war were widely read in Whitehall, though they failed to accelerate British rearmament as much as Morton - and Churchill - considered imperative. Morton had met Churchill on the Western Front in 1916 and supported him throughout the ‘wilderness years’, moving to Downing Street as the Prime Minister’s Intelligence adviser in May 1940. There he remained in a liaison role, with the Intelligence Agencies and with Allied resistance authorities, until the end of the war, when he became a ‘troubleshooter’ for the Treasury in a series of tricky international assignments. Throughout Morton’s career, myth, rumour and deliberate obfuscation have created a misleading picture of his role and influence. This book shines a light into many hitherto shadowy corners of British history in the first half of the twentieth century.

This has been mostly treated as a simple outcome of the change of power. However, this article offers a different perspective on the abolition of spying in 1908 and the subsequent exile of the spies in 1909. This study focuses on the abolition of spying in the Ottoman Empire as a significant idea shaped since the earlier years of the Young Turks' opposition to the rule of Abdülhamid II and followed strictly as a policy after they assumed power. Rather than treating abolition of spying and the exile of spies as a byproduct of the 1908 Revolution, this study takes it as one of the pillars of the Young Turks' ideological discourse and a central policy of the CUP. The article maintains a thread from the origins of Young Turk aversion to spying to the exile of the spies in 1909 following the 31 March Incident. This research aims to contribute to the social history of the late Ottoman historiography by placing the abolition of spying into a larger context together with its agents– the spies.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/CFMJLBS6,2022,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Arda', 'lastName': 'Akıncı'}]",,Journal of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association,author,Arda,Akıncı,

Unsparing in its accounts of dirty tricks and their consequences, it values the agency's intelligence and analysis work to offer balanced judgements that avoid both celebration and condemnation of the CIA. The mission of the CIA, derived from U-1 in World War I more than from World War II's OSS, has always been intelligence. Seventy-five years ago, in the year of its creation, the National Security Act gave the agency, uniquely in world history up to that point, a democratic mandate to pursue that mission of intelligence. It gave the CIA a special standing in the conduct of US foreign relations. That standing diminished when successive American presidents ordered the CIA to exceed its original mission. When they tasked the agency secretly to overthrow democratic governments, the United States lost its international standing, and its command of a majority in the United Nations General Assembly. Such dubious operations, even the government's embrace of assassination and torture, did not diminish the standing of the CIA in US public opinion. However, domestic interventions did. CIA spying on domestic protesters led to tighter congressional oversight from the 1970s on.The chapters in A Question of Standing offer a balanced narrative and perspective on recognizable episodes in the CIA's history. They include the Bay of Pigs invasion, the War on Terror, 9/11, the weapons of mass destruction deception, the Iran estimate of 2007, the assassination of Osama bin Laden, and Fake News. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 diminished the CIA and is construed as having been the right solution undertaken for the wrong reasons, reasons that grew out of political opportunism. The book also defends the CIA's exposure of foreign meddling in US elections.

The level of intelligence synthesis, informative and advisory nature of the Intelligence Community, and available human resources are three organizational factors that can be used to study the requirements and career-spanning effects tasking has for an analyst and their manager. Ultimately, human resources do have a big part to play, but should not be the only guiding factor. Tasking should consider the lifetime development of an analyst. Comfort zones should be breached, with a plan and a goal-oriented approach.

The three major instruments that guide United States foreign policy are the Treaty Power, the War Power, and the Spy Power. Within the category of Spy Power is the ""Third Option"" the use of covert action. Ever since the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947, the US has often turned to the third option in the conduct of its international relations. This controversial approach includes covert propaganda campaigns, subversive political activities, economic sabotage, and paramilitary operations ranging from clandestine warfare to the assassination of foreign leaders. From the beginning of the Cold War to the present day, America's intelligence and national security agencies have employed all of these ""third option"" tools in order to advance America's global interests.In The Third Option, the eminent national security scholar Loch Johnson provides a history of American covert warfare from 1947 to the present. In particular, he focuses on the morality and consequences of America's heavily veiled attempts to shape global affairs through its covert actions. Over the course of the book, a fundamental question comes into focus: Of what value has the Third Option been to the US as a complement to the nation's more open battlefield and diplomatic initiatives? Just as importantly, Johnson exposes the conflict between this controversial approach to achieving America's international objectives and the ideals that the US has always propounded: democracy, human rights, and liberalism. The Third Option closes with a sharp assessment of the policy, measuring its failures versus its successes. A richly detailed synthesis of America's covert action program ever since it became the world's preeminent power, this book serves as an ideal introduction for anyone interested in US foreign and national security policy.

89,Deception and Manipulation in an Intelligence Liaison Relationship: U.S.–Pakistani Negotiations and the 1980s Afghan Program,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/08850607.2022.2157687,"Small-state leaders can profit enormously by collaborating with great powers on clandestine intelligence activities. The United States historically has provided billions of dollars in military and economic aid to intelligence liaison partners that host intelligence collections facilities or support joint covert operations. While many of these relationships are characterized by trust and mutual benefit, others are subject to a constant struggle for control. Unlike the scrutiny paid to overt base negotiations, this clandestine bargaining largely has been overlooked in intelligence and International Relations literature. This review of the negotiations surrounding the U.S.–Pakistani joint covert operations in Afghanistan during the 1980s addresses this void. Declassified documents and memoirs reveal that Pakistani leaders deliberately deceived Washington as to their motives and commitment to the joint Afghan program in order to maximize their negotiating leverage. This case study demonstrates that acquiring accurate information regarding a partner’s intentions is a critical factor in determining power dynamics within an intelligence liaison relationship.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HXWHJFPL,2023-01-23,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Diana I.', 'lastName': 'Bolsinger'}]",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,author,Diana I.,Bolsinger,

I situate Canada’s new legislation against the backdrop of US and Japanese legislative responses and analyze the transition, including Bill C-13 (2014), Bill C-44 (2015), Bill C-51 (2015), and Bill C-59 (2019). I argue that the thrust of this legislative trend has been the active legalization of previously illegal surveillance activities by security intelligence agencies, rather than passive ineffectiveness in restricting state mass surveillance enabled by information and communication technologies. The transition is in synch with a global legislative trend that lowers the legal standards of privacy and personal data protection and weakens checks and balances in democratic governance. As a result, mass surveillance has increasingly undermined and regulated the rule of law, not vice versa., RésuméCet article offre une perspective transnationale sur la réponse législative du Canada à l’élargissement à l’échelle mondiale des activités de renseignement pour la sécurité nationale dans la guerre contre le terrorisme depuis 2001.

Je soutiens que l’idée maîtresse de cette évolution législative a été la légalisation active des activités de surveillance, auparavant illégales, par les services de renseignement de sécurité, plutôt qu’une inefficacité passive à restreindre la surveillance de masse de l’État rendue possible par les technologies de l’information et de communication. Cette transition est en phase avec la tendance législative mondiale à réduire les normes juridiques de protection de la vie privée et des données personnelles et à affaiblir les freins et les contrepoids dans la gouvernance démocratique. Par conséquent, la surveillance de masse mine de plus en plus l’État de droit, cette surveillance devient même une force régulatrice de l’État de droit plutôt que l’inverse.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/EQ8TEITG,2022/08,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Midori', 'lastName': 'Ogasawara'}]",,Canadian Journal of Law and Society / La Revue Canadienne Droit et Société,author,Midori,Ogasawara,

Keen to reduce its dependency on the outgoing British colonial administration, Ghana sought India’s support when both the Cold War rivalry and the Afro-Asian Solidarity were at a peak. In doing so, Ghana inherited a similar set of problems affecting Indian intelligence, which in itself was supported by the British i.e. resorting to colonial policing methods, lack of legislative oversight, and a recruitment system based on partisan loyalties instead of professionalism. The Foreign Service Research Bureau (external intelligence) and the Special Branch (domestic intelligence) effectively secured Ghana’s first prime minister and then president Kwame Nkrumah from real and perceived adversaries. But their methods of functioning fed his authoritarian appetite –ultimately leading to an unceremonious ouster– during a highly turbulent phase in Ghanaian history. The first and only time India helped create, and unofficially lead, another country’s intelligence service, this history sheds light on India and Ghana’s approach towards intelligence in the aftermath of independence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/99Q6PEZ9,2022-07-04,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Avinash', 'lastName': 'Paliwal'}]",,The International History Review,author,Avinash,Paliwal,

The company was controlled by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). The Swiss intelligence services had known about this intelligence operation since 1993 at the latest, had access to relevant information, and allowed the foreign intelligence services to continue their operation until 2018. For the permanently neutral State of Switzerland, this raises the question of how Operation RUBICON is to be assessed with regard to Switzerland's duties under the law of neutrality.
This author finds that it was unlikely that Switzerland, in its complicity in Operation RUBICON, violated its duties under the law of neutrality. However, if—and this is unlikely but cannot be completely ruled out—Crypto AG exported rigged cipher machines or offered maintenance services during (or immediately before) the Kosovo War in 1999 to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or during (or immediately before) the Iraq invasion in 2003 to the Republic of Iraq, Switzerland would have violated its duties under the law of neutrality. At the very least, Switzerland's complicity in Operation RUBICON plays into its image as a Western neutral and is therefore relevant in terms of Swiss neutrality policy. In any case, it is crucial for Switzerland to refrain from complying with intelligence operations such as Operation RUBICON and to preserve (guided by equidistance, international law, and Switzerland's humanitarian tradition) its permanent neutrality, even during today's challenging circumstances.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/INUPP3I6,18 January 2023,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Manuel', 'lastName': 'Rodriguez'}]",,International Journal of Legal Information,author,Manuel,Rodriguez,

When Japanese soldiers were taken as prisoners of war, who interrogated them? When Japanese maps and plans were captured on the battlefield, who deciphered them for Britain? 

When Great Britain found itself at war with Japan in December 1941, there was a linguistic battle to be fought—but Britain was hopelessly unprepared. Eavesdropping on the Emperor traces the men and women with a talent for languages who were put on crash courses in Japanese, and unfolds the history of their war. Some were sent with their new skills to India; others to Mauritius, where there was a secret radio intercept station; or to Australia, where they worked with Australian and American codebreakers. 

 Translating the despatches of the Japanese ambassador in Berlin after his conversations with Hitler; retrieving filthy but valuable documents from the battlefield in Burma; monitoring Japanese airwaves to warn of air-raids—Britain depended on these forgotten ‘war heroes’. The accuracy of their translations was a matter of life or death, and they rose to the challenge.

112,The hidden geography of transnational surveillance: social and technological networks around signals intelligence sites,Thesis,http://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/3614,"This thesis investigates the hidden geography of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) sites, state military bases concerned with the interception, interpretation and communication of information transmitted through technological systems. Focusing on three such sites in North Yorkshire, Fylingdales, Irton Moor, and primarily, Menwith Hill, it examines their histories and functions, and the discourses of different actors and interest groups about these processes and places. The histories, functions and discursive constructions of SIGINT sites are examined using a theoretical framework of surveillance theory, an emerging transdisciplinary field which understands that surveillance, the monitoring and control of actors, is as important to the analysis of contemporary societies as production. The thesis analyses the sites as part of a hidden geography of transnational surveillance and ultimately weaponry. This geography encompasses not only the places themselves, but also socio-technological networks that stretch across land, air, sea, outer space, and the virtual realm. The thesis is an attempt to trace some of this hidden geography, to assign it history and social meaning, and to subject it to critical interpretation. The thesis adopts a semiotic discourse analysis methodology informed by Actor-Network Theory to analyse the data gathered. The concept of discourse, the whole array of ways in which actors describe themselves, others and the world around them, is central to the way in which the thesis examines the evidence relating to SIGINT sites. This evidence includes officially generated and unofficial written documents, academic and non-academic analysis, visual representations, and interviews with key actors. Because these networks of sites are hidden, it does not mean that they cannot be made visible and their presence in the landscape and in society contested. The semiotic structure of the sites has come under attack from actors who derive meanings from their viewing of these places that are at odds with official state discourse, wherein the necessity of surveillance and secret intelligence are bound up with the foundations of the state and with inter-state relationships. This thesis will examine the whole spectrum of rejection: civil rights and privacy campaigners, peace activists, politicians and parapoliticians, Ufologists and conspiracists. These counter-discourses challenge official discourses in different ways, with differing intensities, and with varied outcomes, from failure to appropriation by the state to success in adjusting or supplanting official discourses and practices. The thesis raises questions about the development of the contemporary capitalist state and its relationship to its people and to other states and peoples. Drawing on recent adaptations of complexity theory to the social sciences, and the work of Foucault, Lyon and Chomsky, the trajectory of societies is considered to be strongly influenced by a dynamic tension between the tendency towards panopticism, a total surveillance society, and opposing tendencies towards individual and collective liberation.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VKANFRCL,2001,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'David', 'lastName': 'Wood'}]",,,author,David,Wood,
113,"The public disclosure of Anglo-American signals intelligence since the Second World War, with particular reference to Ultra and Magic",Thesis,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=3&uin=uk.bl.ethos.596093,"The puzzling absence of signals intelligence (SIGINT) from the historiography of World War II for nearly three decades continues to reverberate for historians. This thesis aims to explain how and why SIGINT was protected from public disclosure during and after the war, how it became public in 1974, and how WWII historiography has evolved as a consequence of these revelations. Drawing on a vast range of published sources, interviews and recently available archival and electronic-database material, this thesis is comprised of five chapters. With a brief overview of important precedents, the first chapter traces Pacific theatre SIGINT disclosures from WWII through its early and detailed, although not complete, disclosure during the Pearl Harbour hearings and beyond. The second chapter examines how and why the Ultra secret was kept, despite the belief of the gatekeepers that it would soon be discovered by historians analysing operational details and battlefield decisions. The third chapter reviews chronologically the not insignificant Ultra-related disclosures that went unnoticed by historians prior to the publication of F. W. Winterbotham’s <i>The Ultra secret </i>in 1974. The fourth chapter presents the most complete explanation to date of why Winterbotham was allowed to publish, including a review of important precedents. The fifth chapter follows WWII historiographical development through to the end of the century as Ultra disclosures changed the understanding of the war in Europe and rejuvenated historical interest in Pacific theatre communications intelligence. Finally, an epilogue offers several Cold War historiographical comparisons that provide insight in to Anglo-American SIGINT disclosure and historical understanding of intelligence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VIJBG2KS,2005,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'R.

Drawing upon archives in Britain and Cyprus, and a range of published primary sources, a fresh contribution to First World War intelligence studies is offered through a focus on British counter-espionage efforts in Cyprus after 1916. The article covers Anglo-French intelligence cooperation on the Syrian and Cilician coast, the wartime loyalties of Cypriots and their value as spies, and insights into Ottoman and German human intelligence activity in the region. The primary focus is on the civil-military relations between the Cyprus colonial government and the military intelligence officers. It is argued that Cyprus acquired some importance as a post for intelligence-gathering and especially counter-espionage, but the problems derived from inadequate civil-military relations, disloyal Cypriot subjects, and the island?s status as a backwater hindered its development as a valuable asset in the Near and Middle East theatre.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/AKESRSWZ,2012-07-01,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Andrekos', 'lastName': 'Varnava'}]",,War in History,author,Andrekos,Varnava,

The British Army's campaign against EOKA during the Cyprus Emergency was hamstrung by a dearth of intelligence from within the ethnic Greek population, which formed the insurgent's ranks. The extent of British brutality has hitherto been obscured by a smokescreen of pro-enosis propaganda and government counter-claims, making it difficult for the historian to distinguish fact from fantasy. Documents from Hanslope Park, recently released to the National Archives at Kew, have shed some light on the use of force in British intelligence gathering and interrogation practices.

For a short period, the RGS became a significant metropolitan focus for those advocating a British intervention in the Middle East coupled with an Arab revolt against the Turks, the campaign popularly associated with T E Lawrence. The essay concludes with an assessment of the significance of geography to the British war effort and an evaluation of the impact of the war on the institutions and prestige of the discipline.

But even though it is generally agreed that intelligence is of little use unless it is received and understood by policymakers, we actually know little about why some leaders are receptive toward intelligence, while others are not. This article argues that the willingness of decision- makers to listen to intelligence depends primarily on two factors: their belief in the seriousness of the issue or threat involved, and their trust in the utility of intelligence. It examines contrasting receptivity toward intelligence in the cases of Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway, and suggests that our current models of intelligence–policy relations need to be revised.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/92I43ZJ9,2013,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Erik J.', 'lastName': 'Dahl'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Erik J.,Dahl,

Up to the start of the Nixon administration, the civilian leadership of the Department of Defense had found CIA estimates of Soviet strategic capabilities congenial, because they contradicted the inherent tendency of military intelligence to exaggerate them.

They acted on Moscow's behalf as a check upon the communist parties of the satellite states themselves. The Soviet leaders were aware of the fragility of the communist parties which they had brought to power in Eastern Europe after 1945. The satellite secret police agencies provided information about the developments inside the local parties from the grassroots to the level of the politburo; and, in the event of the collapse of the local communist party, the secret police might provide the only means of preserving Soviet control.

It advances three major arguments. First, efforts to assess and improve warning forecasts must take into account the policy context in which they are made and used. They cannot be based on concerns with the accuracy of forecasts alone. Second, important biases are present in retrospective case studies. Therefore, we should accept post hoc explanations of warning failures with appropriate caution. Third, a pluralistic intelligence community, as it is presently proposed for some non-U.S. systems, is unlikely to resolve the problems thought to be responsible for past strategic surprises. It may in fact compound these problems.

As an informal mechanism, how do they fit into the wider landscape of intelligence oversight? By drawing on examples of US counter-terrorism efforts in the post-9/11 era, the article identifies three roles for the news media in intelligence oversight: as an information transmitter and stimulator for formal scrutinizers, as a substitute watchdog and as a legitimizing institution. Yet there is a danger of the news media acting merely as a lapdog. Other limitations include the impact of regulatory frameworks, government secrecy and the media strategies of intelligence services. The article concludes that the news media play an important role in the wider intelligence oversight landscape, but that their ability to scrutinize is uneven and ad hoc and as a result the picture they produce is blurred.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7CECRE3A,2012,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Claudia', 'lastName': 'Hillebrand'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Claudia,Hillebrand,

Reports of abuse at detention centres such as Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, the ever increasing use of technological surveillance, and the increased attention on the use of torture for intelligence collection purposes have all highlighted a need to make an explicit statement about what is and what is not permissible intelligence practice. In this article an ethical framework will be established which will outline under what circumstances the use of different intelligence collection activities would be permissible.

The growing connectivity between both foreign intelligence services and also domestic security services means that we might speak - not just of growing international co-operation - but perhaps even of global co-operation. This essay considers the complex interplay of intelligence and globalization since 1989. It argues that there is an obvious tension between a developing global style of co-operative activity and the traditional mechanisms of oversight, which have tended to be national. Accordingly, it moves on to discuss the recent efforts by national, regional and international systems of inquiry to examine issues that involve intelligence co-operation. It suggests that while formal committee-type mechanisms have limited purchase, they are not the only options for oversight in a globalized context.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/M8H9CSMP,2009,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Richard J.', 'lastName': 'Aldrich'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Richard J.,Aldrich,

Indeed, many in both political and intelligence circles argue for access to ever greater amounts of cyber information in order to catch potential threats before they become real. By collecting all our digital information, the intelligence community argues that it is not only able to detail what people have done or are currently doing but also predict what their next move might be. However, the ethical implications are unclear and the backlash following Edward Snowden’s revelations have shown that such activities are not without controversy. This leaves the debate stuck between the important, ethical role that intelligence can play and the potential for its unrestrained use to cause undue harm. This paper will resolve this by giving greater detail to cyber-intelligence practices, highlighting the different levels of harm that the various intelligence operations can cause. The essence of this paper is not that cyber-intelligence should be banned outright, but that it can be justified given the necessary circumstances. Therefore, the paper will develop a specialised set of Just Cyber-Intelligence Principles, built on the just war tradition, to outline if and when such activities are justified.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q99CRRBH,2016,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'R.', 'lastName': 'Bellaby'}]",,Journal of Military Ethics,author,R.,Bellaby,

The work looks at whether there is a distinct way in which India ‘thinks about’ and ‘does’ intelligence, and, by extension, whether this affects the prospects of it being surprised. Drawing on a combination of archival data, secondary source information and interviews with members of the Indian security and intelligence community, the book provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of Indian intelligence culture from the ancient period to colonial times and, subsequently, the post-colonial era. This evolutionary culture has played a significant role in explaining the India’s foreign intelligence failure during the occurrences of strategic surprises, such as the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the 1999 Kargil War, while it successfully prepared for surprise attacks like Operation Chenghiz Khan by Pakistan in 1971. The result is that the book argues that the strategic culture of a nation and its interplay with intelligence organisations and operations is important to understanding the conditions for intelligence failures and strategic surprises.

This book will be of much interest to students of intelligence studies, strategic studies, Asian politics and International Relations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DFY7S7S2,29 September 2022,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Dheeraj', 'lastName': 'Chaya'}]",Routledge,,author,Dheeraj,Chaya,

The roles of law, rights and ethics in intelligence are discussed with reference to some of the more controversial intelligence activities: informers, interrogation, intelligence sharing, rendition and covert action.

Powerful new technologies enable the collection, communication, and analysis of national security data on an unprecedented scale. Data collection now plays a central role in intelligence practice, yet this development raises a host of ethical and national security problems, such as: privacy; autonomy; threats to national security and democracy by foreign states; and accountability for liberal democracies. This volume provides a comprehensive set of in-depth ethical analyses of these problems by combining contributions from both ethics scholars and intelligence practitioners. It provides the reader with a practical understanding of relevant operations, the issues that they raise, and analysis of how responses to these issues can be informed by a commitment to liberal democratic values. This combination of perspectives is crucial in providing an informed appreciation of ethical challenges that is also grounded in the realities of the practice of intelligence.

The Germans had full confidence in the Enigma: the scrambler of the machine was such an elaborate one, with three rotors and a plugboard, and the number of possible encoding positions for each letter was such an immensely huge one (it was around 5000 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion, or 5 followed by 87 zeros)2 that they believed their cypher to be absolutely unbreakable. Their opponents nevertheless had succeeded in breaking it since January 1940. This was the result of the joint effort of two teams of cryptologists, one in Britain and the other in France.

The main work of intelligence assessment was conducted by a wider bureaucracy, which utilised both covert and public sources of information. Military intelligence work was done by the three service departments, each concentrating in an independent fashion on the rearmament of its German opposite number. Economic intelligence was gathered by the Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC). A limited coordination of this material was achieved by the Chiefs of Staff (COS).

Supporters of the president downplay White House responsibility and focus instead on the failings of the intelligence community and the possible need for structural reforms. Neither side has it completely wrong - or right. There is substantial evidence that the Bush administration - like many of its predecessors - oversold the threat to sell its preferred policy choice. But any quest to 'fix' intelligence merely through reorganisation will be futile insofar as it avoids the more prosaic but more critical matter of intelligence effectiveness.

270,Eight: Intelligence failure,Book chapter,https://doi.org/10.51952/9781447326427.ch008,"As was highlighted earlier, much of our understanding of intelligence practice comes not from policing, which largely has hidden this facet of its work from public view, but from SIAs. Such knowledge is derived in particular from the US intelligence community, which for many years has encouraged research into its practices and has endorsed both publication of research findings and scholarly reflection on the themes that have emerged from them (often under the auspices of bodies such as the US National Institute of Justice or the Central Intelligence Agency’s Center for the Study of Intelligence). There now is a relatively large body of scholarly research on intelligence failure on which practitioners can draw. There is much less on intelligence success and that is bound to skew the public’s perception of the work. That is just as true of policing as it is of the security milieu. US academic (and national security ‘insider’) Richard K. Betts and a second US academic (and former US Navy intelligence analyst) ErikJ. Dahl persuasively have argued that no matter how many resources the intelligence community is able to call on, no matter how many analytical processes it develops, no matter how much data it collects, crises or calamities – that in the modern era have come to be labelled intelligence ‘failures’ – are inevitable. Against that background, the following questions are posed: To what extent are those analyses applicable to the UK policing milieu? Does the increasing emphasis on big data obscure the intrinsic value of ‘little data’ to intelligence success? What efforts are the police making to manage the risks associated with intelligence failure? The phrase actionable intelligence is a relatively modern creation that links action and intelligence and, intentionally or otherwise (its genesis may have been a calculated act or simply an etymological quirk), invests the product of that association with a utility that neither, on its own, possesses.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9RA3D6WQ,2016/04/27,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Adrian', 'lastName': 'James'}]",Policy Press,,author,Adrian,James,

275,"Surprise, Intelligence Failure, and Mass Casualty Terrorism",Thesis,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7678/,"This study aims to evaluate whether surprise and intelligence failure leading to mass casualty terrorism are inevitable. It explores the extent to which four factors - failures of public policy leadership, analytical challenges, organizational obstacles, and the inherent problems of warning information - contribute to intelligence failure. This study applies existing theories of surprise and intelligence failure to case studies of five mass casualty terrorism incidents: World Trade Center 1993; Oklahoma City 1995; Khobar Towers 1996; East African Embassies 1998; and September 11, 2001. A structured, focused comparison of the cases is made using a set of thirteen probing questions based on the factors above. The study concludes that while all four factors were influential, failures of public policy leadership contributed directly to surprise. Psychological bias and poor threat assessments prohibited policy makers from anticipating or preventing attacks. Policy makers mistakenly continued to use a law enforcement approach to handling terrorism, and failed to provide adequate funding, guidance, and oversight of the intelligence community. The study has implications for intelligence reform, information sharing, Congressional oversight, and society's expectations about the degree to which the intelligence community can predict or prevent surprise attacks.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DMRNQX7D,2006-05-04,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Thomas Edgar', 'lastName': 'Copeland'}]",,,author,Thomas Edgar,Copeland,

It will demonstrate that the British experienced a steep learning curve. Sound theory and practice were no guarantee of success, since victory or defeat was determined largely by local conditions and British political considerations. And some intelligence practices that had been effective in distant conflicts proved problematic when applied in the domestic arena of Northern Ireland.

Scholars focus upon the means of gathering, evaluating, and distributing information with subsequent evaluation of its impact on decision making. Institution-based analysis ignores the role that the intelligence craft plays in the broader social and political context. This is apparent in the case of intelligence failures which reach beyond government to influence public opinion and ultimately the ability of authorities to mobilise support and govern. In the wake of failure, competing elites contest for power with conspiratorial interpretations of events that provide psychological comfort by offering explanations for events, targeting culprits, and fixing blame. This essay considers the intelligence failure of September 11, 2001, and outlines the conspiracy theories of left and right raised in its wake. Among those charged were the usual suspects - Zionists, the anti-Christ, advocates of a New World Order, and members of the military-industrial complex. In response, American government authorities validated their opponents' plot-making by defending themselves with their own cries of conspiracy. Heightened government secrecy, efforts to intensify surveillance, and the rhetoric of fear deepened the intrigue. In such a culture of conspiracy, charges of subversion bring only short-run gain.

This statement elucidates the negative force of cognitive closure on intelligence, as well as bringing attention to the importance of an understanding of the human factor in intelligence production, and its relationship to discourse failure. Intelligence literature after 9/11 has focused on the causes and nature of intelligence failure, though few inquests have conceived intelligence as a deeply cognitive, and therefore mental and moral landscape that needs to be explored in all its complexity. Intelligence operators, like art spectators, perceive reality filtered through all sorts of implicit and explicit ideological prisms, and these ideologies, whether they are political assumptions or social orthodoxies, manifest themselves as cognitive closure, and shape the discourse in intelligence organizations, as well as between these organizations and society at large.

For intelligence, as for other areas of policy, serious intellectual inquiry is the basis for improving the performance of real-world institutions. The volume explores intelligence from an intellectual perspective, not an organizational one. Instead the book identifies themes that run through these applications, such as the lack of comprehensive theories, the unclear relations between providers and users of intelligence, and the predominance of bureaucratic organizations driven by collection.

They often manage large, powerful, unaccountable organisations, which they hold close. But, despite their close relationship with - and reliance upon - intelligence, autocrats also frequently struggle to use it to enhance decision-making and foreign policy, and consequently suffer avoidable intelligence failures. This article argues that Russia?s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is illustrative of this broader, though understudied, pattern of autocratic mismanagement of strategic intelligence. The invasion was both spurred and accompanied by a catastrophic intelligence failure, the responsibility for which rests with Vladimir Putin, the arbiter of a system with limited capacity to offer dispassionate strategic assessments. His failure is characteristic of autocratic regimes assessing foreign developments, including Putin?s Soviet predecessors. This article contributes to the emerging scholarship on intelligence in autocratic regimes by examining Putin?s use of intelligence in the Ukraine War in the context of the broader literature on intelligence and decision.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/92TAMAKQ,2022-12-29,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Huw', 'lastName': 'Dylan'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'David V.', 'lastName': 'Gioe'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Elena', 'lastName': 'Grossfeld'}]",,The British Journal of Politics and International Relations,author,Huw,Dylan,

324,What's the harm?: the ethics of intelligence collection,Thesis,http://hdl.handle.net/2160/8a508bc4-cc47-4910-939c-7affed650bb6,"As the professional practice of intelligence collection adapts to the changing environment of the twenty-first century, many academic experts and intelligence professionals have called for a coherent ethical framework that outlines exactly when, by what means and to what ends intelligence is justified. Recent controversies, including reports of abuse at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, allegations of extraordinary rendition programmes and the ever-increasing pervasiveness of the 'surveillance state', have all raised concerns regarding the role of intelligence in society. As a result, there is increased debate regarding the question of whether or not intelligence collection can be carried out ethically. This thesis will tackle this question by creating an ethical framework specifically designed for intelligence that is capable of outlining under what circumstances, if any, different intelligence collection activities are ethically permissible. This thesis argues that there is a tension presented by intelligence collection between the damage that it can cause and the important, ethical role it can play in the political community. In order to deal with this tension the ethical framework proposed in this thesis is comprised of two parts. The first part is designed to recognise those features of intelligence that might be considered ethically unacceptable by highlighting the 'harm' it can cause. Once the harm is understood, the second part of the ethical framework establishes a set of Just Intelligence Principles that can outline if and when the harms caused are justified. These Just Intelligence Principles are developed by drawing upon the just war tradition and its criteria of just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, last resort, proportionality and discrimination. By placing the harm that intelligence can cause into context with the Just Intelligence Principles it is possible to limit the use of intelligence while recognising the important role it plays in protecting the political community. Once the ethical framework has been established in Chapter One it is then applied to a range of intelligence collection activities in Chapters Two, Three, Four and Five. This thesis will examine three of the most prominent collection disciplines in the field of intelligence studies: imagery intelligence, signals intelligence and human intelligence. By applying the ethical framework established in the beginning of the thesis to these three important intelligence collection disciplines, it is possible to better understand the ethical framework. The main argument of this thesis will be that the most appropriate ethical framework for intelligence collection is one which is able to recognise that intelligence collection does indeed cause harm, but that sometimes this harm is necessary in order to protect the political community.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/N99UTW4A,2011,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ross', 'lastName': 'Bellaby'}]",,,author,Ross,Bellaby,

It investigates intelligence on the counterinsurgency in South Vietnam, on the intentions and capabilities of North Vietnam, and on the probable consequences of policy options. The first half of the thesis examines the Vietnam intelligence during the Kennedy administration, following the rise of optimism in 1962 and the intelligence dispute in 1963. The second half of the study explores intelligence developments from the fall of the Diem regime in November 1963 to President Johnson’s decision to take military action against North Vietnam in February 1965. The study suggests that intelligence deficiencies played a significant role in both the failure of counterinsurgency in the first half of the 1960s and in the decision for direct military intervention in 1965. The thesis also demonstrates that, rather than simply being a result of technical weaknesses, the lack of robust intelligence reflected wider problems of Vietnam policy, including political pressures, ideological contexts and the absence of strategic consensus.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3XACQT68,2011,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Yukiko', 'lastName': 'Ochiai'}]",,,author,Yukiko,Ochiai,

336,"Sir Robert Cecil and Elizabethan Intelligencing, 1590-1603",Thesis,http://oro.open.ac.uk/78595/,"Much scholarly attention has been given to the development of Sir Francis Walsingham’s intelligence-gathering network and how it played an important role in Elizabethan foreign and domestic politics during the 1580s, but little has been attempted for the 1590s. This thesis will argue that the practices and methods that Walsingham laid down did not completely dissipate after his death but in fact continued to be adhered to, most notably in the person of Sir Robert Cecil. It was Cecil who, more than any other Elizabethan in high authority, looked to create his own intelligence-gathering network as he foresaw the benefits of doing so. However, this transition was by no means straightforward, and in fact it can be seen as disjointed.

The thesis will also show that the rise of Cecil’s intelligence-gathering network became intertwined with the rise of his political career. It was not until he became principal secretary in July 1596 that the creation of his own network could really proceed apace. The make-up and construction of his intelligence-gathering network will be discussed, as will the backgrounds of the people who worked for Cecil: his secretaries, his agents and message carriers. In sum, it will be shown that Sir Robert Cecil created by 1603 an effective intelligence-gathering network that was put to good use in the final years of Elizabeth’s reign and continued into that of James I.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/24GQT9TL,2021-08-04,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Christopher', 'lastName': 'Mains'}]",,,author,Christopher,Mains,

The system had two roles; to collect information and process it into intelligence for policy and decision making and to provide machinery to coordinate and implement covert action in support of policy. The ‘system’ consisted of parallel information channels; interconnected, coordinated, and directed by committees at various levels. Analysis was mainly conducted in Whitehall departments. The system reflected the split between ‘security’ and ‘foreign’ intelligence and the ‘information gathering’ and ‘covert action’ roles in the British machinery. The system paralleled the British professional intelligence machinery headed by the JIC and this division prevented information from being fully integrated with other consumers in Whitehall. The system was shaped by four major factors: threats; experience; the nature of the administrative system; and the development of professional agenda in both the administration and security organisation (the Security Service and Colonial Police Service) which dictated the points of reform and development over time. Before the Second World War information gathered by ‘police’ and ‘administrators’ was used to manage a colony’s internal politics. The end of ‘colonial isolation’ during the 1930s and 1940s meant colonial problems affected the British state’s international prestige and later its ability to fight the Cold War. To counter this, Whitehall departments sought information to increase their control over colonial affairs, despite the opposition of the Colonial Office which was used to a degree of autonomy. The Colonial Office was more closely coordinated into Whitehall. Colonial and metropolitan intelligence systems were connected and common practices and product formats adopted. Whitehall tried to use ‘counter subversion’ to shape colonial politics. Security intelligence became increasingly important in the last stages of decolonization because, it was the last source of information handed over and consequently it shaped Whitehall’s reactions to events. The machinery also assisted the British to maintain their influence in new states after independence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GI8USFKS,2015,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Gregor', 'lastName': 'Davey'}]",,,author,Gregor,Davey,
338,"Information, frontiers and barbarians: the role of strategic intelligence in the relations of the late Roman Empire with Persia and northern peoples",Thesis,https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.19021,"Strategic intelligence - that is, information about the activities and affairs of potential enemies relevant to a state's strategic concerns - is an important factor in the foreign relations of any state. This thesis investigates the role of strategic intelligence throughout Roman relations with Sasanian Persia (early 3rd to early 7th century A.D.) and in the empire's relations with northern peoples beyond the Danube, Rhine, and Hadrian's Wall while these remained imperial frontiers during the same period. Two broad questions are addressed. The first concerns the extent to which strategic intelligence moved between the empire and these neighbouring peoples, and its consequent role in their relations. The second concerns the means by which this information moved. Chapters 1 and 4 consider the first question for relations with Persia and with northern peoples respectively. The first chapter argues that strategic intelligence moved between the Roman and Persian empires with a high degree of regularity: neither could mount a major invasion without the other having some foreknowledge, and both frequently undertook aggressive action so as to exploit knowledge of the other's disadvantages. It is therefore argued that strategic intelligence had an important role in determining the pattern of aggression in Roman-Persian relations, but also in limiting the overall level of warfare between them across four centuries. Chapter 4 concludes that while strategic intelligence also traversed the northern frontier, it did so with less regularity than in the east, with the result that relations in the north were less stable. Chapters 2 and 3 consider how strategic intelligence moved between the Roman and Persian empires. Attention is given to the use of embassies and spies in the gathering of intelligence about military preparations and other indicators, but it is argued that such information also made its way informally between the empires as part of the intensive cross-frontier interchange which characterised northern Mesopotamia. Chapter 5 argues that such interchange was less frequent across the northern frontier, and that the more limited degree of state formation among northern peoples (compared with Persia) meant that information gathering through spies and embassies was also less effective. The Conclusion draws together the results of this comparison of east and north, and reflects on the implications of the argument for the debate about continuity of the empire in the east and its demise in the west.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VIEGECKY,1987,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'A.

339,Israel and Africa : military and intelligence liaisons,Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/252040,"For more than three decades, from the mid 1950s to the late 1980s, Israel’s activity in Africa was central to the former’s strategic, security, and foreign polices. Israel was a young, poor, small, and inexperienced country in those years, but it was able to use its advantages to become a major player on the great African continent. Because of a convergence of both Israeli and African interests, the essence of these bilateral relations was covert and focused mainly on the security and intelligence spheres. Israel’s military and intelligence activity in Africa is a remarkable story of a small country’s ability to build on its advantages and reap the benefits. A thorough examination of this important subject has never been conducted before. This research intends to fill the gap. Israel’s African initiative placed it on the front lines of the cold war struggle over the destiny of the continent. At certain times and in particular regions, Israel was almost as involved as either of the superpowers – and sometimes even more so – and it played a decisive role in influencing domestic developments in some countries and in bilateral African relations. Also, Africa’s indisputable value as an intelligence arena gave birth to a manifold of intelligence work carried out there by <i>Mossad</i>. The dissertation makes use of massive documentation, which has never before been published, including inner correspondence of Israeli Intelligence, Military and Diplomatic corps, and many interviews with key officials. The research leads to the conclusion that the intricate history of Israeli involvement in Africa reflects the transformations within Israel’s diplomatic, defence and intelligence decision-making processes. This is true not only in the confinements of the African arena, but also in a broader, world-wide perspective. In other words, the processes of historical transformations within Israel are reflected in the micro-level of Israel’s presence in Africa.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E3EDFLC4,2007,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ronen', 'lastName': 'Bergman'}]",,,author,Ronen,Bergman,

For Iran and the non-Soviet Bloc powers, Iran’s newly established intelligence and national security organisation (SAVAK) had become an entity whose counter-intelligence capabilities were crucial in curtailing the activities of Soviet and Soviet-aligned intelligence officers within Iran. The intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, the KGB and GRU, were highly active within Iran in both seeking to gather intelligence and to undermine the Pahlavi regime and it was left to the SAVAK’s counter-intelligence directorate to pursue the difficult task of combating these efforts. This Cold War battle extended to Iraq where Iraqi governments were viewed by the SAVAK as being proxies for Soviet interests. As a result of such concerns the SAVAK’s foreign intelligence structure sought not only to gather intelligence but also to directly influence events within Iraq. Iran's counter-intelligence and foreign-intelligence structures therefore played a critical national security role during the Cold War years 1957-1968. This research will firstly explore how the SAVAK’s foreign intelligence activities ultimately led to the establishment and expansion of Iranian intelligence collection and analysis capabilities in its regional sphere of interest. Intelligence theory is also used to examine the SAVAK's counter-intelligence and foreign intelligence structures and operations during the stated period of investigation, together with the influence of Cold War thinking on its activities. The main strands of inquiry in this research will at the outset involve the question of why Iran felt it necessary to establish professional foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence capabilities. The structure and operational methods of these capabilities will then be examined along with the reasons for why the USSR and Iraq were targeted by Iranian foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence. The important relationship between intelligence and policy formulation and execution will also be analysed in this specific period of the Cold War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E7F93XM5,2011,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Kaveh', 'lastName': 'Kaveh Moravej'}]",,,author,Kaveh,Kaveh Moravej,

This inquiry puts forward the idea of a 'Europe of anti-terror intelligence cooperation' to challenge false beliefs and, in particular, two dominant representations of intelligence relationships. Despite the British opt-out from Justice and Home Affairs and ‘Brexit’, it disputes not only the assumption whereby Britain has an ambivalent position towards the European Union as a result of its ‘special relationship’ with the United States but it also debunks the myth of the unbreakable allegiance of British services to the American 'friend'. By contrast, it shows that alliances with European services have long been in development and have formed, over time, a space of relationships which is structured around specific stakes and modalities of action. The contribution of sociology, notably through Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts, is crucial since it breaks with the dominance of rational choice theory and functionalist approaches and puts the role of social actors and their daily 'ways of doing things’ at the core of the inquiry. It is, therefore, by carrying out an ontological and an epistemological rupture with previous studies that this project can shed light on the ‘Europeanness’ of British services.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RNYSIR7A,2018,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Hager', 'lastName': 'Ben Jaffel'}]",,,author,Hager,Ben Jaffel,

V. Jones. This thesis constitutes a critique of this history; through scrutiny of Jones’s post-war literature (especially his war memoirs entitled Most Secret War), his archival papers and those of his colleagues and contemporaries, and other mediums he used to promote his account of scientific intelligence. This thesis examines chronologically all of the key events Jones became famous for – the Battle of the Beams, the Bruneval Raid, the Radio War, the Battle of the V-Weapons – and compares Jones’s account of these (and many other) events with contemporary documentation. This thesis provides a rich understanding of the internal machinations within the British wartime air scientific intelligence organisation defined as ADI (Science), and their relationships with the many other political, military and intelligence sections that pursued similar and often closely-linked quests. This thesis importantly connects science and technology with the collection and collation of intelligence, is an analysis of wartime intelligence of a scientific and technical nature, and argues that scientific intelligence was much more than one man’s accomplishments, involved many more individuals and organisations than is perceived, and is much more important to twentieth century history than has been permitted.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2IQ6T78H,2013,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'James Martinson', 'lastName': 'Goodchild'}]",,,author,James Martinson,Goodchild,

strategy and military capabilities during the Pacific War is a subject that has been
neglected. Using archival material that has been previously unused, this thesis
will examine the manner in which intelligence influenced the British military
establishment's perception of its Japanese adversary. Moreover, it will attempt to
determine the effect that intelligence had on British war plans in the Far Eastern
theaters. Using the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict in July 1937 as the
starting point, the thesis will illustrate the extent to which Britain's
miscalculation of its adversary prior to Japan's declaration of war on the West in
December 1941 was due to the absence of reliable intelligence. In addition to
the obstacles created by the secretive manner in which Japan conducted its
diplomacy and strategic planning, Britain's lack of first-hand experience in
dealing with its adversary prevented its military establishment from grasping the
dangers that could be posed by japan's expansionist moves. The shock created
by Japan's spectacular victories in Southeast Asia following the outbreak of war
in December 1941 was necessary to convince Britain that Japan was in fact both
willing and capable of challenging the West. Furthermore, Britain's reverses
brought home the extent to which its forces in the Far East were inadequate. As
the conflict progressed, the British military establishment used the intelligence
obtained through its encounters with Japan's armed forces in order to obtain an
accurate picture the threat that its enemy could pose, as well as to determine the
most effective means by which the challenges could be overcome. The thesis
will therefore attempt to shed new light on Britain's conduct of its war against
Japan by illustrating the extent to which first-hand combat experience was
necessary in order to enable the military establishment to accurately assess its
enemy, and to devise an effective strategy by which to defeat it.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PN6S9HFX,2002,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Douglas Eric', 'lastName': 'Ford'}]",,,author,Douglas Eric,Ford,

From 1941, when the first US intelligence agents arrived in the area, until late 1944, when the Anglo-American covert contingent largely departed to follow the Allied armies on their advance into the Axis heartland, the city served as a regional headquarters in the secret war against fascism. Utilising a comparative approach, this dissertation analyzes the three main geographical areas covered by the Algiers-based secret networks. New archival research and oral testimony is used to illuminate important topics in the field: particularly the history of wartime intelligence in Italy. The discrepancy between the disappointing Anglo-American clandestine campaign in Italy, and the more successful experience in France, is probed. Drawing on these investigations, and ongoing trends in the historiography of intelligence, it comes to the following conclusions on the nature of the secret war. First, the universal application of special operations, regardless of political or military conditions in the target country was ill-judged. Second, the British and American intelligence agencies were engaged in a constant struggle for authority and leadership. A cooperative approach was usually favoured by the stronger power; the weaker party viewed ‘cooperation’ as a euphemism for subordination. Finally, Allied policymakers sometimes ignored or misinterpreted intelligence that did not fit their political priorities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/AFFY2MQL,2005,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'T.

Part two of the thesis examines how this exclusion elevated the role of overt intelligence as a substitute form of intelligence; ‘the power of the press’ in this context is a very apt term. The enemy and neutral press were acquired, analysed and any relevant intelligence gained was quickly distributed around the various government departments by the FRPS. The key role the FO played in requesting, prioritising, and utilising the information provided by the FRPS Baltic States Section and the FRPS Russian Research Section is also examined. Part two of thesis concludes with a study of the fruits of the FRPS Russian Research Section’s labours and how its work influenced British post-war policy towards the Soviet Union.
Finally part three examines the content of this overt intelligence in two case studies concerning German Economic Policy and Population Policy. Britain’s wartime policy towards the Soviet Union is then described in order to set the work of the FRPS in context.
The thesis is not an attempt to complete a top-to-bottom study of the German occupation of the Baltic states, but rather to present the contemporary British perspective on this occupation, a perspective which was derived almost entirely from overt intelligence.

It stretches from the point when the Soviet Union entered the Second World War as Britain's ally in 1941, to the moment a decade later in 1951, when the Cold War had set in and Moscow was the bitter enemy of the west. Using recently declassified Security Service (MIS) records, it examines how Britain's intelligence services met the massive transition from World War to Cold War. It reveals a variety of subjects previously undocumented in the secondary historical literature, such as MIS's concerns after the Second World War with terrorism emanating from the Middle East. The dissertation is an attempt to rescue intelligence from historical obscurity and place it in its justified position: as a central component in the process of political decision-making in Britain. As well as offering new historical insights, it provides useful lessons for governments and intelligence agencies at the start of the twenty-first century.

The effective collection and management of intelligence by Special Branch dominates this paradigm. However, the intelligence architecture during Emergency was much more complicated than the simple Special Branch-Army nexus upon which existing studies focus. Other components of the intelligence included the Malayan Security Service (MSS), Security Intelligence Far East (SIFE), the Joint Intelligence Committee / Far East (JIC/FE), the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Army, and the mainstream police. Each component adapted to the challenge of insurgency in different ways – the civilian elements faring far worse than the military. Britain struggled to adapt to the post-war intelligence challenges in the Far East. Key intelligence components and capabilities were constituted in haste with overlapping and ambiguous remits. Consequently, there was bitter infighting at a number of levels, particularly between the various civilian intelligence agencies. In contrast, the Army and RAF demonstrated an instinctive ability to work in a ‘joint’ environment from the very beginning of the Emergency. In particular, the RAF took a leading role in creating a joint theatre-level intelligence apparatus which included establishment of a Joint Operations Room in Kuala Lumpur and the Joint Intelligence Photographic Intelligence Committee / Far East. However, the military were unable to provide the comprehensive human intelligence or strategic leadership necessary to make the broader apparatus effective. This could only come once the apparatus led by the civil agencies – chiefly the uniformed police as well as Special Branch – had learnt to adapt to the demands of waging a counter-insurgency campaign. Given that the British intelligence organisations had learnt to function in a joint manner during the Second World War, it is remarkable how much had apparently been forgotten in the three years preceding the outbreak of the Communist 1 AIR 20/7777, Report on the Emergency in Malaya, from April 1950 to November 1951, by Sir Harold Briggs. insurgency in Malaya and how long it took to create an effective method of coordinating intelligence during subsequent Emergency.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6MDMCWFP,2016,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Roger Christopher', 'lastName': 'Arditti'}]",,,author,Roger Christopher,Arditti,

There were three main drivers behind the development of British foreign intelligence through this period. These were: the influence of political and administrative culture; the apathy of the military establishment; and the involvement of intelligence officers within policymaking. These latter two steps were guided by the effect of British political and administrative culture. These twin cultural influences informed the character of Britain’s foreign intelligence structures, along with Britain’s nascent intelligence culture, as they adopted state governance principles. Inter-departmentalism, involvement within the ‘committee system’, cooperation, and achieving consensus were, to varying degrees, the defining principles of Britain’s burgeoning intelligence machinery. These principles served to impel the animosity of the military establishment, while facilitating the intelligence institutions’ involvement with the civilian sphere and policymaking. By 1914 Britain’s foreign intelligence structures had become incorporated into the civilian sphere, acting as bridges between the civilian and military spheres of the British state facilitating the flow of information in both directions. This thesis will illustrate how important an influence a nation’s political and administrative culture can be upon the evolution of its intelligence agencies. The period from 1870 to 1914 laid the foundations for the shape and character of Britain’s modern intelligence community, establishing principles and an intelligence culture that persist to this day.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YP4U5SE3,2022,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Adam', 'lastName': 'Gordon'}]",,,author,Adam,Gordon,

The former had an incentive to develop Pan-Islamism as an element of the 'special feature' policy they were employing to assist in securing victory in the First World War. This was a policy 'to foster and encourage any movements of unrest and sedition', including the Pan-Islamic movement, 'directed against the British Empire'.1 The latter, who, due to the military needs of the European empires, had been forced to converge in East Africa in a manner never previously seen, conversed about Pan-Islamism amongst themselves. Officials of the British Empire identified that Pan-Islamism had manifested itself into two threats: Pan-Islamic unity and the use of the machinery developed by Pan-Islamism by those who advocated for Pan-Africanism. The developing counter-intelligence arm of the British imperial intelligence establishment worked to counter these threats. This development resulted in the institution of the East African Intelligence Centre in 1917. They were successful: to a point. The British Empire in East Africa was not destroyed by Pan-Islamism during the First World War. But they were unable to remove the threat posed by Pan-Islamism from the East African region. In the early Twentieth Century the United Kingdom had revolutionised its intelligence establishment, but it had failed to realise that counter-intelligence in the British Empire had not been accounted for.

More specifically, it examines the counter-subversive policies and measures conducted by the British Intelligence and Security Services, and Britain’s secret propaganda apparatus, the Information Research Department (IRD) of the Foreign Office, in Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iran, during the period between 1949 and 1963. This thesis is also about intelligence liaison – the relationship between British Intelligence and Security Services and their Middle Eastern counterparts. This thesis argues that the British Empire declined between 1949 and 1963; in this, intelligence was understood by British policymakers as a tool to maintain British influence and preserve British strategic and economic interests in the Middle East. The imperial drive derived from a mixture of strategic and economic interests in the region but it was Britain’s anti-Communist attitudes which were shared with Middle Eastern governments. This was the context in which intelligence liaison was established between Britain and Middle Eastern states on the basis of their common interests. Although Britain’s anti-Communist policy contributed to preventing the spread of Communist movements in the region, it sought to strengthen the repressive capability of Middle Eastern governments which undermined their own political position by their repressiveness. An unintended consequence was that the Middle Eastern governments conducted counter-subversion not only against Communists, but also their own people. This thesis concludes that Britain’s anti-Communist policy sustained British influence and British interests in the region in the short term, but failed to sustain its objectives in the long term.

367,'Secret towns': British intelligence in Asia during the Cold War,Thesis,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/81565/,"The British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) remains one of the most obscure and elusive government agencies. Despite its rich and often tangled past, the SIS withstood various challenges in the twentieth century to become a vital instrument in Britain’s foreign policy, offering both traditional intelligence gathering, and a covert action capability. Despite recent revelations about its Cold War history, knowledge about this organisation is uneven at best, and this is particularly so in Asia. Despite Britain’s imperial history, which anchored informal intelligence gathering networks on a global scale, SIS’s presence in Asia is largely undiscovered. This thesis asks why this lacuna exists in SIS’s history; what was SIS activity in this region during the Cold War? Moreover, what was the value of this activity? Utilising a primarily archival methodology, this thesis sheds light on British intelligence activity in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Hanoi in the late 1960s. The strategic aims are twofold. Firstly, it explores the kinds of intelligence gathered, and the difficulties encountered from operating within the heart of a secure communist state in order to gauge an ‘enemy society’. In doing so, it challenges conventional definitions of intelligence, pointing to the notion of a dual identity diplomat-intelligence officer, that provided alternative means of acquiring intelligence within denied areas. In this way, it opens a window into a new dimension of SIS history, and, by extension, GCHQ, both of whom operated from the grey space between diplomacy and intelligence. Secondly, it examines this intelligence through the broader framework of the Anglo-American Special Relationship, given that these three case study countries were areas where the SIS operated, but where the CIA encountered real hindrances due to a lack of diplomatic premises. By tracing the path of British intelligence material, and analysing its reception by its American audience, it ultimately assesses the value of such intelligence. It argues that the granular detail afforded, and the insight on broader strategic relationships it provided, inverted the Special Relationship, rendering Britain a valued partner when it came to intelligence collection in this region and off-setting imbalances elsewhere.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T7BJLEIQ,2016,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Nikita', 'lastName': 'Shah'}]",,,author,Nikita,Shah,
368,Intelligence and command at the operational level of war: the British Eighth Army's experience during the Italian Campaign of the Second World War 1943-1945,Thesis,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=12&uin=uk.bl.ethos.497686,"Intelligence was declared by Clausewitz to be a source of uncertainty on the
battlefield, and he advised commanders to rely on their intuition instead. It is a
paradox of the Second World War that when, as never before, an abundance of
intelligence was available to Allied commanders, Clausewitz's dictums still
influenced some of their operational decisions. This thesis explores this duality,
and how it influenced the relationship between intelligence and command at the
operational level of war during the conflict. It does so through the medium of the
British Army, in particular Eighth Army's operational performance - under
Bernard Montgomery, Oliver Leese and Richard McCreery - at defining
moments of the Italian campaign.
The thesis demonstrates the ambiguity present within the British Army's
doctrinal attitude towards intelligence at the operational level, which was
reflected in the
.
tardiness with which intelligence was incorporated into the
army's operational machinery during the first half of the war. That this was
eventually achieved was illustrated by the general efficacy of Eighth Army's
intelligence organisation in Italy, and the viability of its intelligence product.
Nevertheless, the peculiarities of the Italian theatre reduced the productiveness
of the chief sources of intelligence, and created occasional, but critical, gaps in
the intelligence picture. This only partially explains, however, why Eighth Army's
operational performance in Italy was punctuated by intelligence failure. Under
Montgomery and Leese, intelligence was merely an ancillary, and often
sidelined, tenet of their operational technique, and it was only under McCreery
that Eighth Army practised intelligence-led warfare. These findings seriously
question the historiographical belief that, by the second half of the war, the
British Army had fully and unconditionally incorporated intelligence into its

Undertaking an empirical approach throughout, the thesis begins by using the intelligence cycle to assess who constitutes the British Intelligence Services, and what portrayals the Big 3 – the Security Service (MI5), the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) provide of themselves on their websites and by speeches made by the respective heads. This is compared to the portrayals of the British Intelligence Services provided by key avenues of information, namely, the Government, academia, news journalism and popular culture. Whilst all the avenues provide an overall positive portrayal of the British Intelligence Services, with a consistent emphasis upon acting legally and ethically, due to the diversity of these avenues, each provides a subtly different depiction of the British Intelligence Services. Due to the pervasiveness of secrecy surrounding the British Intelligence Services, these avenues are in an influential position of informing the public domain about the intelligence realm. But, by finding a balance between openness and secrecy and increasing their own public engagement beyond the websites which require an individual to know they exist and actively access them, the British Intelligence Services could limit the role of the avenues by having a more cohesive and ongoing relationship with the public domain.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8KUXLGFX,2019,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Abigail Julia', 'lastName': 'Blyth'}]",,,author,Abigail Julia,Blyth,

Churchill proves to have been a voracious reader of diplomatic intercepts from 1941-44, and used them as part of his communication with the Foreign Office. This thesis establishes the value of these intercepts (particularly those Turkey- sourced) in supplying Churchill and the Foreign Office with authentic information on neutrals' response to the war in Europe, and analyses the way Churchill used them. Turkey was seen by both sides to be the most important neutral power and therefore constitutes the case study for this analysis. The thesis answers the question 'why did Turkey interest Churchill.' by tracing his involvement with diplomatic intercepts back to 1914, and then revealing how the Government Code and Cipher School (GCCS) was empowered to continue monitoring such traffic until 1939, when 'Station X' was established at Bletchley Park (BP). Following two chapters that trace the interwar work of GCCS on the secret diplomatic traffic of most major powers and outline Turkey's place amongst those powers, the thesis concentrates on four events or processes in which Churchill's use of diplomatic messages played a part in determining his wartime policy, which was sometimes at odds with that of the Foreign Office. Chapter four answers the question what use did Churchill and the Foreign Office make of bjs to persuade Turkey to join the Allies between 1940 and 1942. Chapter five offers a new explanation of why the Adana conference of January 1943 produced little change in Turkish foreign policy. Chapter six explains the Dodecanese defeat of 1943 in the light of the signals intelligence Churchill was reading. Chapter seven shows the results at GCCS in London of the theft of secret Foreign Office papers in Ankara from November 1943: whether actual bjs were included in these papers; how they were received in Berlin and subsequently in Berne, Washington and London; and how they led to a breakthrough in reading the German diplomatic cipher, too late to be useful to Churchill. The thesis concludes by emphasising the personalised nature of wartime diplomacy and re-iterates the reasons why Churchill and the Foreign Office attached such importance to their 'Most Secret Sources', though their availability to historians requires little change to the record.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GGFYTI6V,1997,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Robin', 'lastName': 'Denniston'}]",,,author,Robin,Denniston,
375,"Espionage in British Popular Culture of the 20th Century: Gender, Moral Ambiguity and the Inextricability of Fact and Fiction.",Thesis,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/133517/,"This analysis of cultural representations of British intelligence between 1945 and 1999 explores three intertwined themes: constructions of gender identities; the representation of morality and moral dilemmas; and the relationship between fact and fiction. Cultural representations of spies are a particularly rich source of analysis of the three themes given the character of the profession, which has captured the public imagination, but about which information in the public domain is erratic and selective. The primary source base includes 89 British novels and 53 films (both cinema and television), cartoons and newspaper articles. A formalist approach to these sources is complemented by cultural materialism in order to work closely with the texts while emphasising the importance of the political and social contexts in which these sources were produced and consumed. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first identifies contrasting typologies of masculinities and femininities in popular representations. The spectrums of masculinity depend upon bisecting axes: the maverick/organisation spectrum is determined by the spy's role in and relationship to the organisation; the peacock/chameleon spectrum is determined by visibility and tradecraft and is more responsive to social change than the former category. Women fall on a singular spectrum ranging from Angel to Patriot to Whore. While these three categories are remarkably consistent over time, by the end of the period under investigation the new category of the Professional emerges who blends the three. The second section is thematic and maps these gender constructions on to two dominant themes of popular representations of espionage: betrayal and moral complexity. Part two explores the cultural circuit between the public and fictional representation of spies and the implicit and explicit explorations of gender identities thus generated in a period marked by major public scandals in the espionage world. The thesis concludes that although this is a genre which is little constrained by public knowledge of the world it depicts, it is nonetheless heavily constrained by societal norms and deeply revealing of gender roles, particularly masculine ones.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IXQI672F,2015,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Kirsten Ann', 'lastName': 'Smith'}]",,,author,Kirsten Ann,Smith,
376,The military career of General Sir Henry Brackenbury 1856-1904,Thesis,https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/2425,"This thesis deals with a largely forgotten soldier, writer and administrator of the mid  
to late Victorian era. General Sir Henry Brackenbury’s career covered some forty- 
eight years. He was either directly involved in or was witness to all the major events  
of the British Army during this period, from the Crimean War to the South African  
War. His career encompassed an era of reform that saw the army move away from the  
military system of the Napoleonic Wars and the gradual establishment of the  
system with which the British Army would take the field in 1914.  
 
The aim of this thesis is to look at the military career of Sir Henry Brackenbury,  
rather than be a biography of the man. However his literary career, personal life and  
financial circumstances are intrinsically linked to his life as a soldier. What this shows  
is a highly intelligent soldier, perhaps the first of a new bread of so-called ‘Scientific  
Soldiers’, men who studied and thought about their profession.  
 
Apart from a considerable, and important, amount of active service overseas,  
Brackenbury held three key administrative positions, which were the highlight of his  
army service and allowed his talents to come to the fore. As Head of the Intelligence  
Branch at the War Office, Military Member of the Council of the Governor General  
of India, and Director General of the Ordnance, he ended his long career with  
powerful and important positions that brought much praise. Indeed his contemporaries considered him to be the most effective holder of these posts.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PGISAQHG,2009,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Christopher', 'lastName': 'Brice'}]",,,author,Christopher,Brice,

As the first full length academic study of the BBC Monitoring Service, this thesis seeks to examine one of the earliest historic attempts to systematically manage and exploit publicly available, open source information for intelligence purposes. It utilises the Imperial War Museum’s rarely used collection of BBC Monitoring transcripts, in conjunction with traditional archival sources and oral interviews, to trace the origins, processes and institutional structure developed by the Monitoring Service during its formative years. This study further assesses the collection priorities of BBC Monitoring during World War Two, traces the historic flow of monitored material around the wartime Government and BBC, and establishes the institutional role of BBCM in the conduct of Britain’s war effort. Three case study chapters, focusing on the outbreak of war, Dunkirk and D-Day, particularly assess the process and detailed collection priorities of the Monitoring Service during key events throughout the war. This study thus makes a contribution to the historic picture of British intelligence during World War Two, and is bound to encourage future study of the BBC Monitoring Service and its archives. Overall, the BBC Monitoring Service is judged a historic success story. This thesis argues that this success can be attributed to three key qualities developed during the wartime period: trust, breadth, and adaptability. The organisation established a relationship of trust with the Government; developed and maintained a remarkable breadth of broadcast coverage; and showed a constant ability to adapt to both customer demands and changing strategic priorities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/X3HB5RND,2013,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Laura Marie', 'lastName': 'Johnson'}]",,,author,Laura Marie,Johnson,
378,"The Palestine Exploration Fund, 1865-1914",Thesis,http://hdl.handle.net/2381/35576,"Founded in 1865, the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) was for the first 20 years of its existence both the principal British exploration society in the Holy Land and a surveying organisation which was heavily dependent upon the work of and support of the Royal Engineers. From 1865 to 1886 PEF functioned as an independent organisation dependent for its work and existence upon the intelligence department of the War Office. Employing Royal Engineers, men and officers, the Fund surveyed western and eastern Palestine, Sinai, and completed a geographical survey around the Dead Sea. Its surveyors included Charles Wilson (later Sir Charles Wilson), Charles Warren (later Sir Charles Warren), Claude Conder and H. H. Kitchener (later Lord Kitchener), and its supporters and organisers included many notable men of the day. The survey operation linked closely with the need for a full map of the Holy Land area in order to protect and police the eastern hinterland to the Suez Canal. After 1890 the PEF became an archaeological organisation employing William Flinders Petrie (1891), Frederick Jones Bliss (1891-1900), R. A. Macalister (1900-09) and lastly Duncan Mackenzie (1910-1912). From 1913 to 1914 the PEF reverted to its former role of intelligence gathering for the War Office and employed Leonard Woolley and T. E. Lawrence as archaeologists and as a cover for Royal Engineers under Captain Newcombe who surveyed the Wilderness of Zin area. After 1918 the British Mandate in Palestine rendered such uses of the PEF obsolete. This thesis examines the composition of the PEF, its foundation, the involvement of the military intelligence departments with PEF, its financial basis and its relationship to the British involvement in the Middle East. It does not examine the PEF's role in archaeological history, but concentrates upon its work as a Victorian imperial institution.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7QPPJR4E,1996,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'John James', 'lastName': 'Moscrop'}]",,,author,John James,Moscrop,
379,MI9's escape and evasion mapping programme 1939-1945,Thesis,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/3553,"This thesis examines the programme of mapping produced on silk, and other fabric, by MI9 to facilitate the escape and evasion of British military personnel during World War II. It considers the creation of MI9 in December 1939, the rationale for the new military intelligence branch and the context of the history of military mapping on silk. The map production programme is described, together with its progress and the challenges faced. The various groups of maps are identified and described, together with the source maps on which they were based. This description is developed in nine appendices produced as an integral part of the research to provide a comprehensive carto-bibliography of the 234 individual maps which have been identified. Location details of extant copies in British map collections are also provided. The ingenious methods of smuggling the maps into the camps, with other escape aids, in apparently innocuous leisure items are described. The maps were then copied and reproduced to support the escapes. Coded correspondence with the camps is discussed, and a successful deciphering of some of that correspondence is provided. The implications for the escape and evasion programme were considerable, but so too were the implications of the passage of intelligence from the camps to aid the war effort, a factor apparently largely overlooked in previous studies of the wartime role of the intelligence branches. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate the role and importance of the contribution made by the maps to the escape and evasion programme. The conclusion assesses the significance of this little known episode in British historical cartography of the twentieth century which essentially provides the latest chapter in the story of military mapping on silk, and other fabric, through the ages.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E25GVRFX,2014,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Barbara A.', 'lastName': 'Bond'}]",,,author,Barbara A.,Bond,

The importance of this topic was highlighted by revelations in 2003 and 2005 concerning two senior republicans who had both been working for British intelligence for decades. The uncovering of these two senior spies created intense debate within the media and Irish republican community as to whether the IRA ended its military campaign largely because of significant infiltration. Yet, surprisingly, there has been no dedicated academic study of the impact of informers and agents upon the IRA. A few academics have briefly considered this topic in recent monographs and journal articles. Whilst acknowledging other important factors, they argue that intelligence successes against the IRA played a crucial role in influencing that organization to end its military campaign in 1998. This first in-depth study of the influence of informers and agents on IRA and British strategies during the Troubles cross-references new extensive interview material alongside memoirs from various Troubles participants. Its central argument is that the elusive nature of many rural IRA units, its cellular structure in Belfast, and the isolation of the IRA leadership prevented the organization from being damaged to any considerable extent by spies. In fact, the IRA’s resilience was a key factor encouraging the British government to try to include republicans in political settlements in 1972, 1975 and the 1990s. The IRA’s military strength also points towards the prominence of political factors in persuading republicans to call a ceasefire by 1994. The role of spies in Northern Ireland and the circumstances in which the state permitted negotiations with the IRA are key considerations for those interested in other small-scale conflicts.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/EHXCMUIZ,2015,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Thomas Daniel Melchizadek', 'lastName': 'Leahy'}]",,,author,Thomas Daniel Melchizadek,Leahy,

The question of control over war-ravaged, but strategically significant Germany was critical to the security of Europe. As such, Germany and Berlin in particular, became the most important Cold War battleground in Europe. By combining recently released JIC archives with both existing research on intelligence, foreign and defence policy and records from the other government departments, this research adds to the understanding of one of the central themes of the Cold War. It reveals how ministers, senior officials and military officers made use of the assessmentps roduced by the JIC in formulating their policies towards Germany and the developing threat from the Soviet Union and its allies. This research takes a chronological approach, in order to trace both the development of policy and of the role of the JIC within central government. It explores the major crises of the period: the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948, the riots in East Berlin of June 1953 and the 1958-61 Berlin Crisis. Away from these crises, the thesis examines the picture that the JIC painted of Soviet intentions and capabilities in Eastern Germany and of the development of the two German nations. It also looks at the JIC's contribution to British attitudes towards German rearmament. The developing role of the intelligence apparatus, both within central government and in Germany is a major theme running through the thesis. By improving its sources, its product and its administration, the JIC ensured that it became an essential tool for successive governments, and within Whitehall, became the interface between intelligence and policy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GQVXA2UV,2009,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Simon', 'lastName': 'Case'}]",,,author,Simon,Case,
382,"Soviet intelligence services in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939",Thesis,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=76&uin=uk.bl.ethos.570090,"Unsurprisingly, one of the important, controversial, much speculated and least known aspects
of the Spanish Civil War is the role of Soviet intelligence services. Every scholar who tries to
tackle this problem will soon find out how notoriously hard it is to ensure accuracy, truth and
objectivity in writing about secret intelligence and counterintelligence. There the whole
purpose of governments is not to document but to hide the facts, and there, too, witnesses are
unlikely to know the full truth underlying even the events in which they personally
participated. As a result, the interpretation of these secret doings can quickly coagulate in
false patterns. Writers deprived of access to fresh facts, original documents and ability to
professionally assess the information tend to copy what other have written although that may
be largely guesswork, misinformation and speculation. Any single surviving fragmentary
detail gains value because no other is recorded, even though it may stem from ignorance or
partisanship, and by repetition it gains credibility and becomes history. In recent times, there
has been a growth of interest to this particular topic due, first of all, to the efforts of the
imminent British intelligence historian Professor Christopher Andrew, and because more and
more original documents became available to researchers. There are, nonetheless, still major
gaps in our knowledge of wartime intelligence in what concerns Soviet operations on the
Republican territory and outside it. Who were the people sent by the Soviet government?
What was their mission brief and how they carried out orders? What was their influence, if
any, on the outcome of the war? How did secret intelligence influence Stalin's decisions in
relation to Spain at various periods of the conflict? This work cannot hope to cover the vast
programme of research on intelligence and the war history or international relations albeit in a
very short period of three years (1936-39), but it seeks to give scholars, researchers and
students of intelligence better access to primary sources from many archives, oral histories,
memoirs, books and articles in several languages otherwise little known, totally unknown or
very hard to acquire. This previously unknown information may help the historian to make
different conclusions from what seemed an established fact, was misinterpreted or

383,Britain's exploitation of Occupied Germany for scientific and technical intelligence on the Soviet Union,Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/226719,"At the beginning of the Cold War, the gathering of intelligence on the Soviet Union's 
current and future military capability seemed a near-impossibility. Soviet high-level 
communications were secure against decryption. Agent networks in the USSR were 
very difficult to establish and of uncertain reliability. Aerial reconnaissance of warrelated 
targets in the Soviet Union was risky and could only be occasional. But 
valuable intelligence was gathered in the years 1945-55 on the USSR's frantic arms 
build-up, thanks to its policy towards Germans and their country. Its exploitation of 
Germans and its Zone of Germany in its war-related research and development and 
the reconstruction of its war-related industries gave British Intelligence penetrable 
targets in the Soviet Zone and gave great numbers of Germans sought-after 
information on the USSR itself. The ease of recruiting age nts in East Germany and 
the flight (including enticed defections) of refugees from it allowed research and 
development projects and uranium.-mining operations there to be penetrated. 
Intelligence of Soviet weapons development and of the quality of Soviet military 
technology was obtained. The mass interrogation of prisoners-of-war returned by the 
Soviets to the British Occupation Zone in the late 1940s yielded a wealth of valuable 
information on war-related construction and the locations of numerous intelligence 
targets in the Soviet Union: most importantly, those of atomic and chemical plants, 
aircraft and aero-engine factories, airfields, rocket development centres and other 
installations. When, in the period 1949-58, some 3,000 deported German scientists , 
engineers and technicians were sent back to their homeland from the USSR, 
promising sources among them were enticed West and interrogated for their 
knowledge of the Soviets' research and development projects. The cream of the 
information they provided was crucial intelligence on the locations of atomic plants 
and laboratories and uranium deposits; useful information on structural weaknesses in 
the Soviet system of scientific and economic management; expert (if out-of-date) 
assessments of the quality of Soviet accomplishments in atomic science, electronics 
and other fields; and well-informed indications as to possible lines of development in 
guided missile and aircraft design. One Soviet scientific defector in Germany 
provided similar information which influenced British perceptions of the Soviet 
Union's scientific potential and missile development plans. Refugees entering the 
British Zone from East Germany, intercepted letters and monitored 
telecommunications, informal contacts and, of course, secret agents all made 
significant contributions to the gathering of scientific and technical intelligence in 
Germany too. The British passed to the Americans much of the intelligence they 
acquired in Germany and the installations identified and located by German sources 
were overtlown by spyplanes in the 1950s and particularly by U-2s in the latter half 
of-the decade. Priceless information was obtained, which establi shed that the USSR's 
war-related scientific research and development and its actual military capability were 
both inferior to those of the West. Thus the Germans enabled Soviet security to be 
deeply penetrated and helped to stabilize the Cold War. They are the missing link 
between Ultra and the U-2.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HVS8MZQP,1999-01-26,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'John Paul', 'lastName': 'Maddrell'}]",,,author,John Paul,Maddrell,
384,The Political Warfare Executive: a re-evaluation based upon the intelligence work of the German Section,Thesis,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6022/,"Conventional interpretations regarding the role of the Political Warfare Executive during the Second World War have concentrated almost exclusively on the propaganda output of the organisation. The role of the intelligence sections working for and within the organisation have been largely disregarded or overlooked in the existing history of Executive. This thesis offers a re-evaluation of the PWE which includes this `missing dimension', specifically here the intelligence work of the German Section of the Executive. This approach widens the scope of enquiry to include an exploration of the links between intelligence and propaganda, subversion and sabotage and considers the importance of this relationship for the way in which the PWE emerged. The examination of the Weekly Reports of the German Section identifies a different `type' of intelligence which can be described as `social political' intelligence, which provided the British government with a unique view of the social and political conditions in Germany throughout the duration of the war. The thesis concentrates on the period after the announcement of Unconditional Surrender in January 1943 to the early months on 1946, when the personnel and expertise of the German Section were transferred to the Foreign Office. The analysis of the intelligence reports of the German Section is focussed on three particular issues of interest to government at the time and to historians today. These are German resistance and public opinion, British occupational rule, and the emergence of the perception of the Russian `threat' in Whitehall which signalled the beginning of the Cold War. Taken together these illustrate the way in which the PWE incrementally expanded it's activities over this period of time, and provide the basis for the re- evaluation of the Executive.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9PQT8G3P,1996,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Pauline', 'lastName': 'Elkes'}]",,,author,Pauline,Elkes,

passing intelligence about the top secret British and American atomic 
programmes to representatives of Soviet intelligence organisations. The 
information that they provided made a significant impact upon Soviet atomic 
research, allowing the USSR's scientists to copy the technologies developed 
by the Manhattan Engineering District (MED), and accelerating the arrival of 
the Soviet atomic bomb by at least a year. 
This dissertation examines the various interactions between these Atom 
Spies and the counter-intelligence organisations in Britain and the United 
States, using a comparative framework. The first chapter examines how 
these individuals were cleared to work on top secret atomic research and 
draws broader conclusions about the security policies employed in each 
country. Moving into the postwar period, the second chapter involves 
discussion of how the defection of Soviet cipher clerk lgor Gouzenko and the 
intensification of the Cold War affected both atomic security and collaboration 
between Britain and the United States. The middle section analyses counterespionage 
operations against the Atom Spies in Britain and America, 
emphasising the role of Signals Intelligence and comparing the investigative 
strategies employed by MI5 and the FBI. The penultimate chapter 
investigates the effect of the Atom Spy cases on atomic security, and includes 
a detailed examination of the case of Bruno Pontecorvo, a British-based 
atomic scientist who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950. Lastly, some of the 
broader consequences of the Atom Spy cases are discussed; as shall 
emerge, the exposure of the Atom Spies played a major role in the postwar 
evolution of both the atomic and intelligence relationship between Britain and 
the United States, as well as contributing to the American debate over the 
need to develop a Hydrogen bomb.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BCKBREWW,2008-05-20,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Timothy Samuel', 'lastName': 'Gibbs'}]",,,author,Timothy Samuel,Gibbs,

institutional, organisational, personnel, operational, methodological
and technical aspects of naval intelligence work, the developmental
aspects of its history from 1880 to 1945. By analysing specific naval
operations and discussing the strategic and tactical ramifications of
intelligence it seeks to throw light on the impact of intelligence on
naval warfare in this period. In so doing it reveals the place of
intelligence in the general naval history of the period. It is not a
definitive history, but rather a discursive analysis of those aspects
considered the most important.
In the pre-1914 era the N.I.D. was the heart of the
emergent Naval Staff, involved in strategic planning at the highest
level. World War I brought the need for an operational intelligence
organisation, with the priority of locating, identifying, and deducing
the intentions of major German units. Experience in war revealed

International intelligence archives present a “deeper level”, where personal relations and grand strategy intertwined to shape international diplomacy. Intelligence reveals that Churchill conducted an “unofficial” policy against France in the Middle East. During the war, Churchill embarked on a secretive and ambitious effort to reorganize the Middle East under British hegemony. In order to create a Jewish State and consolidate British control, he opted to support Arab dreams for a Greater Syria which would include the French Levant. Churchill knew that British agents, led by Spears, were conducting a campaign of systematic subversion to oust France from the region. He permitted this operation despite knowing that de Gaulle had evidence on it and despite what it was doing to Anglo-French relations. Eden disagreed with this policy. Intelligence material reveals that he opened a secret channel to de Gaulle and orchestrated a “manoeuvre” to regain control of British grand strategy. Eden’s clandestine diplomacy failed and Churchill was allowed to ruin Anglo-French relations. Intelligence shows that, for larger strategic aims, Churchill betrayed France and made de Gaulle an “enemy of Britain”.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3WGUBKF6,2020,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Matthew', 'lastName': 'Hefler'}]",,,author,Matthew,Hefler,

Academic study of security, defence and intelligence-related organisations during the Cold War are by now quite well-established in the Anglo-American sphere; however, to this day there is no academic analysis of BRIXMIS. This thesis is going to fill that gap. It will look at the entire duration of the mission, from its foundation in 1946 to its closure in 1990, linking it with Whitehall policy-making. The study will shed light on British intelligence operations in the immediate aftermath of 1989, where BRIXMIS’ capacities continued to play a crucial role. Ultimately, the point will be made that the mission’s expertise and utility surpassed its existence, because they were being used by policy long after the mission had been terminated. The study will conclude by establishing the value of the mission for Whitehall policy-­‐making and intelligence analysis, thus answering the overall question: that the mission was indeed, and rather unexpectedly, a great provider of vital intelligence. It will become clear how the perception of the mission as an intelligence operation on the part of decision-­‐makers in London changed over time from scepticism to great appreciation and admiration.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2WS8VZUP,2020,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Frederic', 'lastName': 'Ischebeck-Baum'}]",,,author,Frederic,Ischebeck-Baum,
390,"Sir Basil Thomson and the Directorate of Intelligence : a British experiment in 'high policing', 1919-1921",Thesis,http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/19235,"Within current British Intelligence literature, there is an absence of any detailed examination of the Directorate of Intelligence (DoI), led by Sir Basil Thomson, a policeman. The DoI was created mostly from the Metropolitan Police Special Branch in 1919 by Cabinet decision, primarily to counter post-Great War Bolshevik inspired activism. It became the first civilian domestic Intelligence organisation in Britain, heralding the formalisation of 'high policing', despite the natural British dislike of such 'Continental' practices. This research, utilising traditional historical archival methods, is largely underpinned by Brodeur's 'high/low' policing theory. Firstly, the original English aversion to 'Continental' policing practices is explained with reference to the evolution of the French Police in the early nineteenth century. This is set against the backdrop of natural liberties enjoyed in England. Specifically, it was the suppressive 'high policing' under Joseph Fouché, Napoleon's Minister of Police that was of concern. This was an important factor in preventing the inclusion of such practices when the Metropolitan Police and Provincial Forces were formed. Secondly, in examining the DoI, it is argued that rather than the military, the police were given the domestic Intelligence function for constitutional reasons. Thomson's weekly reports to the Cabinet provide insight into how he organised the DoI to execute its mandate. Three examples are detailed to show its work: the 1919 Police Strike, the Nationalist insurgency in Ireland and associated violence on the mainland as well as counter-Bolshevik propaganda. Thirdly, negative accepted wisdoms in literature regarding Thomson are challenged, showing that despite the DoI's sudden abolition in 1921, it had been efficient and had provided valuable intelligence to government. An aberrant recommendation by the 1921 Secret Service Committee led to the DoI's abrupt termination by Prime Minister Lloyd George. Efficiency was the reason given for his decision, without Cabinet consultation, when the prevailing view among some Parliamentarians was that that the organisation was too 'Continental' in its work, something that was unacceptable with the lessening of the post-war crises.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BH7NCQM5,2019,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Mohamed Hanif', 'lastName': 'Majothi'}]",,,author,Mohamed Hanif,Majothi,
391,"British Intelligence Services in Greece, 1940 - 1947",Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/297314,"This dissertation seeks to address two key themes, drawing on archives in Britain, the United States, and Greece. Firstly, it examines the impact of British Intelligence on the Greek war effort, resistance to Axis occupation, and the period after liberation, by examining the changing role of intelligence in each period. During the early part of the war, the Intelligence Services, and in particular the newly founded Special Operations Executive, sought to achieve their aim of stoking resistance in Greece to help the British war effort through a number of operations. The failure of these operations, however, would have a lasting impact on their future work in Greece. After the stunning success of SOE Operation ‘Harling’, British officials in Cairo and London increasingly fostered guerrilla warfare, making their mission in Greece extremely complex. This was particularly true of SOE, which now entered the hazardous world of guerrilla politics even as it was now serving an equally important political and diplomatic role. While relations between the British and EAM (the communist-led National Liberation Front) had initially been cordial, relations soured as the war progressed and post-war ambitions became more pressing. Eventually, the understanding between the two sides broke down completely and, only a few months after the liberation of Greece, the British government was in open conflict with the guerrillas of EAM. This leads on to the second key theme of the dissertation: the ramifications of the involvement of British Intelligence on the Greek Civil War, and in particular the effect of the dual policy followed by the British in Greece, trying to achieve what proved to be mutually exclusive military and political aims. It will also seek to elucidate whether British involvement in Greece helped to exacerbate the conditions in Greece which led to Civil War, an ongoing topic of scholarly and public controversy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ALLPSAJA,2019-10-26,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Constantine', 'lastName': 'Capsaskis'}]",,,author,Constantine,Capsaskis,
392,British intelligence and American neutrality during the First World War,Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/265571,"This PhD examines the role of British intelligence in Anglo-American relations during the period of American neutrality in the First \Vorld \Var. Unbeknownst to the Americans, British intelligence began to intercept and decrypt virtually all American diplomatic telegrams between Washington and U.S. diplomatic outposts throughout Europe. Although several studies of Anglo-American relations in this period exist, none consider British intelligence's role. Providing an analysis of the relevant cod.es and cryptographical developments during the war, the thesis traces British intelligence's progress in deciphering these various diplomatic codes and offers an analysis of the distribution and use of this intelligence material. Through an exploration of this intelligence aspect, this thesis challenges existing interpretations of British and American policy in this period. A crucial conflict at the heart of British policy-one missed by previous historians-existed over the importance of the United States. Presaging America's international role later in the twentieth centu1y, many of Britain's leaders came to seriously doubt that, without the United States, the war remained winnable at all. Yet these officials contended with a second, powerful faction that remained wedded to outmoded ideas of America's limited relevance on the global stage and that refused to accept the existence of practical limits to British power. This conflict play~ out in several areas of British policy-over diplomatic, military, financial, and political affairs. Intelligence, however, provea a favoured weapon. Intercepted communications, sometimes ripped from their context, caused serious but spurious paranoia that the Americans were collaborating with Germany. Previous scholars, however, by ignoring the weapon, have failed to see the battle. Until it entered the war, American policymakers worked t:u:elessly to achieve a peaceful settlement. Previous historians have entirely dismissed the significance of these efforts, casting them as well-intentioned but futile. In reality, however, those British leaders who understood Britain's dependence on the United States tended to favour these proposals as a useful way of ending an unwinnable war that was bleeding the country d17- This PhD makes a significant contribution to the history of British intelligence, British policy, and American diplomacy during the period of American neutrality during the First World War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QIAF56RE,2014-01-07,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Daniel Richard', 'lastName': 'Larsen'}]",,,author,Daniel Richard,Larsen,

concentrates on the close connection between the British and Spanish gathering of
intelligence and the military decisions adopted in London and Madrid during the
war. The ultimate purpose of this study is to put this war in a broader context and
make a contribution to understand the development of the state in eighteenth
century Europe.
The first part of this study analyses the structure and functioning of the several
British and Spanish Intelligence Networks, i.e. diplomatic and political support to
these networks, expenditures, flowing of intelligence, messengers, agents,
collaborators and counter intelligence. This part consists of two chapters, as
follows: (a) the British Intelligence System and (b) the Spanish Intelligence
System.
The second part of the study explores the connection between the gathering of
intelligence and decision-making in Madrid and London. However, the study of
the use of intelligence can be problematic. This is because neither on the British
nor the Spanish side are there official cabinet records for this period that could
directly link one process with the other. In an attempt to solve this difficulty it has
been decided to study the connection through four case studies. Each of them will
concentrate on one of the military expeditions that Britain and Spain carried out or
planned during the war.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QTLKZVXD,2009-07,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'I.', 'lastName': 'Rivas Ibáñez'}]",,,author,I.,Rivas Ibáñez,

Rather than assuming InTs reflect a homogenous ill-intentioned group of individuals that deviate from organizational norms, we consider the importance of general social psychological and personality factors for detecting and responding to InT, especially within the Western intelligence and security context.

The focus of American foreign policy and national security on counterterrorism efforts in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks further shaped the dynamic between diplomats and intelligence officers in the field as well as their respective roles. The tension between diplomacy and covert action as policy-implementing tools was largely resolved to the benefit of the latter. Consequently, a new status quo emerged. Intelligence officers took a leading role in policy-implementation efforts through covert action, whilst the role of diplomats in the field evolved in line with counterterrorism-driven foreign policy and national security needs. This analysis introduces a new typology of diplomats in the twenty-first century, contrasting the multifaceted diplomatic activists, who advanced counterterrorism-driven diplomacy, against the traditionalists seeing this new diplomacy as bellicose and against American national interests.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RZA8Q8NJ,2022-04-03,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Magda', 'lastName': 'Long'}]",,Diplomacy & Statecraft,author,Magda,Long,

Through a detailed examination of the relevant primary sources – including aerial photography recently released to the National Collection of Aerial Photography in Edinburgh - this book investigates the role of British photographic interpretation in the hunt for German V-weapons during Operation Crossbow. In so doing, it provides a wealth of information on such matters as the wartime development of photographic interpretation, the techniques used by the interpreters, the personalities involved, the significance of photographic intelligence to the operation, and the wider politics of wartime intelligence. In particular, it contests some of the claims made by R. V. Jones in his memoir, Most Secret War (1978), about the role of photographic interpretation in the Crossbow investigation. It also demonstrates the wider importance of photographic intelligence in the British military history of the war and offers some explanation as to why this has become a ‘missing dimension’ of wartime intelligence studies. The critical review seeks to provide an academic superstructure for the book, which was intended for a general readership, and demonstrates that the research included therein is commensurate with that required for a PhD.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T375SEC9,2016,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Allan Robert', 'lastName': 'Williams'}]",,,author,Allan Robert,Williams,

429,"The British intelligence community in Singapore, 1946-1959 : local security, regional co-ordination and the Cold War in the Far East",Thesis,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/23515/,"Singapore was the stronghold of British intelligence in the Far East during the Cold War. The small city-colony played host to a diverse range of British intelligence organisations including regional outposts of MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), specialist technical intelligence centres, open source reporting centres and the police Special Branch. These intelligence outfits operated across three levels: the local, the regional and the national. This thesis investigates the British intelligence milieu in Singapore, focusing upon its organisation and status; its working culture and operations; and its impact or influence. In so doing, the thesis interrogates to what extent we can speak of a definable British intelligence 'community' in Singapore during the early Cold War. It concludes that there were instead two distinct communities: a local intelligence community, and a regional-national one. Nevertheless, there were two core similarities. Security intelligence was at the forefront of both communities as the most appropriate response to the nature of the Cold War both within Singapore and the Southeast Asian region. Secondly, both intelligence communities played a significant role not just in shaping official perceptions but as avenues for covert policy implementation. At the regional level, intelligence activities enabled Britain to fight the Cold War through clandestine measures, fulfilling the key policy goal of providing containment without (extensive) commitments. Locally, security intelligence was a major driving force in the engagement between the Singapore government, communist 'terrorists' and anti-colonial nationalists. This thesis is not just about British intelligence in the Cold War. It also provides original insight into Singapore's transition to self-government between 1946 and 1959 by focusing on the crucial role played by Special Branch. Intelligence services were vital in ensuring that Singapore was rendered 'safe' for decolonisation, and their activities indicate continuity between colonial and post-colonial government in Singapore.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/64ARHSV3,2019,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Alexander Nicholas', 'lastName': 'Shaw'}]",,,author,Alexander Nicholas,Shaw,

Spies deep behind enemy lines; double agents; a Chinese American James Bond; black propaganda radio broadcasters; guerrilla fighters; pirates; smugglers; prostitutes and dancers as spies; and Asian Americans collaborating with Axis Powers.

All these colorful individuals form the story of Asian Americans in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of today's CIA. Brian Masaru Hayashi brings to light for the first time the role played by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans in America's first centralized intelligence agency in its fight against the Imperial Japanese forces in east Asia during World War II. They served deep behind enemy lines gathering intelligence for American and Chinese troops locked in a desperate struggle against Imperial Japanese forces on the Asian continent. Other Asian Americans produced and disseminated statements by bogus peace groups inside the Japanese empire to weaken the fighting resolve of the Japanese. Still others served with guerrilla forces attacking enemy supply and communication lines behind enemy lines. Engaged in this deadly conflict, these Asian Americans agents encountered pirates, smugglers, prostitutes, and dancers serving as the enemy's spies, all the while being subverted from within the OSS by a double agent and without by co-ethnic collaborators in wartime Shanghai.

Drawing on recently declassified documents, Asian American Spies challenges the romanticized and stereotyped image of these Chinese, Japanese, and Korean American agents—the Model Minority-while offering a fresh perspective on the Allied victory in the Pacific Theater of World War II.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JXKHIUAG,2021-10-14,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Brian Masaru', 'lastName': 'Hayashi'}]",Oxford University Press,,author,Brian Masaru,Hayashi,

During those years, the Hamas practice was to apply different degrees of detention and torture of those suspected of collaborating. However, in some cases, Hamas chose a different tactic of exploiting collaborators to transform a threat into an opportunity. Hamas turned some collaborators into double agents, using them to advance its objectives. This article examines some of the doubling operations carried out by Hamas on Israeli collaborators over the last three decades. Examining these cases reveal how Hamas’s doubling methods developed over time, concurrently with the movement’s evolution. Thus, the doubling operations became more organized and sophisticated, being used for propaganda and deterrence purposes as well as other goals. The article explores an interesting aspect of Hamas’s counterintelligence activity in its struggle against the state of Israel. In addition, it sheds light on how a nonstate organization can use doubling of sources as part of its asymmetric war against a state.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ELS98FQ8,2023-01-02,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Netanel', 'lastName': 'Flamer'}]",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,author,Netanel,Flamer,
459,Privatizing Civil Society: Outsourcing Governance in John le Carré’s post-Cold War Novels,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2022.2151760,"John le Carré’s post-Cold War novels investigate the effects of the disinvestment in Euro-American civil societies and the diminishing justifications for securing democracy and the ‘free world’. As privatization and outsourcing function as primary techniques of ‘good governance’ in many western nations, security studies has offered numerous analyses of this phenomenon, particularly with the privatisation of military force in light of the GWOT. By putting contributions in security studies in dialogue with le Carré’s post-Cold War novels, I argue that le Carré’s post-Cold War novels explore how outsourcing war strategies during the Cold War become essential components of statecraft and security during the neoliberal moment when economic national security dominates in the face of the loss of clear sovereign enemies and state actors. Specifically, le Carré’s post-Cold War novels dramatise critically how market-driven security works between national or international legal orders, particularly in colonial and neocolonial contexts. I conclude that le Carré’s novels reveal an important ethical function for literature in modelling speculative scenarios for reflection on intelligence, security, and transformations in sovereignty while this paradoxical reality unfolds",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2R99X2GW,2022-12-09,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'J.

Twice daily, the Detachment provided intelligence to the USS Buchanan (DDG-14), US Navy SEALS, and Special Forces units including tactical and strategic forecasts of enemy movements, information that was otherwise unavailable to U.S. units and advisors in-country.

In the weeks before the offensive, vital agent reports and verbal warnings by the 571st MI Detachment had been ignored by all the major commands; they were only heeded, and then only very reluctantly, once the Offensive began. This refusal to listen to the intelligence explains why no Army or USMC organizations were on-call to recover prisoners discovered or U.S. personnel downed behind enemy lines, as in the BAT-21 incident, as the last two Combat Recon Platoons in Vietnam had been disbanded six weeks before the offensive began. The lessons and experiences of Operation Lam Son 719 in the previous year were ignored, especially with regard to the NVA’s tactical use of tanks and artillery.

The bombings in Madrid in March 2004 have demonstrated how terrorists and criminals can continue to exploit the limits of hesitant or partial exchange to dangerous effect. Intelligence and security cooperation remain problematic because of the fundamental tension between an increasingly networked world, which is ideal terrain for the new religious terrorism, and highly compartmentalized national intelligence gathering. If cooperation is to improve, we require a better mutual understanding about the relationship between privacy and security to help us decide what sort of intelligence should be shared. This is a higher priority than building elaborate new structures. While most practical problems of intelligence exchange are ultimately resolvable, the challenge of agreeing what the intelligence means in broad terms is even more problematic.

This has, largely, been due to access. But this is changing. The chapter goes on to place a cautiously optimistic assessment of the current state and likely evolution of global intelligence studies. It outlines how, over the past decade, the field has expanded and morphed. It has integrated new perspectives and approaches, and it has internationalised.

From the late 1870s, the United States military, as part of a broader reform process, began learning about intelligence in part from experience but more importantly by observing the practices of the great powers of Europe. The period of American involvement in World War I saw a rapid acceleration of this dev.elopment, with the United States continuing to 
learn from the United Kingdom and France. The war also saw intelligence spreading into fields that it had seldom if ever entered in the American experience. During the 
nineteen months of American belligerency American Intelligence agencies, notably the War Department's Military Intelligence Division and the Navy Department's Office of Naval Intelligence expanded greatly. In addition, the services started to adopt high technology tools such as aerial photography and signals intelligence. 
These new tools required the admission into the military departments and services of esoteric specialists who did not fit previous military stereotypes. The war also 
occasioned a vast expansion of domestic surveillance and intelligence, a result of the idea that the World War was a struggle not only of militaries but of entire societies. 
Espionage, too, grew in extent and sophistication and the moral stigma associated with it began to erode. Overseas, the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France grew its own large intelligence staff. All of these measures allowed General John J. Pershing, the AEF's commander, as well has other American leaders to be better informed than they had ever been during previous wars.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9PKSIVCS,2010-06,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Mark', 'lastName': 'Stout'}]",,,author,Mark,Stout,

Part of the British strategic agencies were dedicated to geographic intelligence through divisions, sections, and departments that analysed the terrain over which potential military movements could occur. This article provides an analysis of British reports on the Canary Islands as a case study of wartime geographic intelligence. It shows how the information collected supported the design and updating of British invasion plans on the islands between 1940 and 1943.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T2STZ254,2022-02-23,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Marta García', 'lastName': 'Cabrera'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Marta García,Cabrera,

It applies a new analytical framework for postmortem exercises after foreign policy crises, which centres on nuanced discussions of surprise and contextualised assessments of performance.

This article identifies several ways in which the operation was shaped and sometimes constrained by the compromises the Bletchley Park authorities had to reach with outside organisations to secure the resources they needed.

Kim was born in Vladivostok and educated in Japan. He was recruited by the VChK in the early 1920s and was involved in a variety of Soviet counterintelligence operations directed against Japan. Arrested and tortured during the Great Purge, he was the only Soviet Japanese intelligence expert to survive. Kim was released after the end of WWII and reinvented himself as a writer of spy fiction, arguing that the Soviet Union must score victories against the West on the literary front. The article examines Kim’s impact on the literary Cold War by analyzing his most significant spy fiction works, none of which have been translated into English, and chronicles his influence on the later generation of Soviet spy fiction writers, such as Yulian Semyonov and Vasily Ardamatsky, much better known in Russia and in the West.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MQELT3I4,2022-06-07,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Filip', 'lastName': 'Kovacevic'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Filip,Kovacevic,

Before and after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, however, the UK and US governments have deployed intelligence extensively to influence external audiences, both publicly and privately, regarding Russian intentions, capabilities and practices, and the consequences of Russian actions. While the scale, manner and initially pre-emptive nature of these disclosures represent a significant evolutionary step in how liberal-democratic governments use their intelligence assets, current practice has built upon historical precedents. This article examines why states choose to use intelligence – including fabricated intelligence – for influencing external audiences; the different methods they deploy for doing so; the gains and costs of publicising intelligence; and how the use of intelligence during the Russia–Ukraine conflict should be understood within broader historical and contemporary trends.

Germany replaced Russia and the Comintern as the primary target. The arm of German military power which commanded the most attention was the Luftwaffe, Germany's new air force. The bomber was the only weapon with which Germany could directly threaten Britain; by which London and the industrial Midlands could be made vulnerable; which could strike at the civilian population. Out of this nexus of strategic anxieties, the air staff created their ‘worst-case’ assumption. The worst case, as the air ministry consistently saw it during the 1930s, was a massive German air attack launched against Great Britain with the object of forcing a quick surrender, primarily through the collapse of civilian morale. Group Captain J. C. Slessor, director of plans in the air ministry (and a future chief of the air staff), admitted in his memoirs that,’ in those years immediately before the war the possibility of what was referred to as the knock-out blow bore very heavily on the minds of the Air Staff’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/N3P39VG4,1982/09,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Wesley K.', 'lastName': 'Wark'}]",,The Historical Journal,author,Wesley K.,Wark,

Intelligence cooperation via outer space, described as the ‘strategic essence’ of this relationship, is poised for transformation. New technologies are being developed for satellite communication, with laser systems capable of bypassing ground control stations outside US territory. As a result, the one indispensable role for Australia in US national security—hosting infrastructure to relay intelligence about nuclear and missile activity—could become irrelevant in the years ahead. With questions raised about the Trump administration’s commitment to security partners and the risk of US disengagement from Asia, these findings have implications for Australian alliance diplomacy. If intelligence ties bind these countries together at present, Canberra can expect some risk of loosening in the future and will need to think carefully about the development of national intelligence resources over the long term.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZQ3UIEAW,"July 4, 2018","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'David', 'lastName': 'Schaefer'}]",,Australian Journal of International Affairs,author,David,Schaefer,

617,Enemy Within: The Challenge of Domestic Terrorism,Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrD1t1dxJvs,"After supporters of former President Donald Trump assaulted the Capitol building on January 6th in response to his false claims of electoral fraud, the issue of domestic extremism leaped to the forefront of the public’s consciousness and became one of the highest priorities of US law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Despite increased scrutiny, the problem is hardly a new one. Analysts’ warnings, overlooked for years, are now receiving renewed attention. And domestic extremism creates novel challenges for national security agencies in a democracy. What exactly is the nature of threat? What are the potential responses? How do we stop it while protecting civil liberties? What roles do the FBI and Department of Homeland Security play in countering it? What should the intelligence community do?

The Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security is pleased to present a conversation that addresses these questions and others on this pressing issue. Joining us are Andrew McCabe, former Deputy and Acting Director of the FBI, and Elizabeth Neumann, former Assistant Secretary for Threat Prevention and Security Policy at the Department of Homeland Security. David Priess, Hayden Center senior fellow and chief operating officer of the Lawfare Institute, moderates the discussion.

The Hayden Center is located at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government in Arlington, VA. Gen Hayden, our founder, has been a distinguished visiting professor at Schar School for 11 years. Andrew McCabe and David Priess have joined the Schar School faculty this academic year.

618,Spy Writing in the Real World,Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s94WHs2zkJ0,"The Intelligence Community has found itself making real world headlines in recent years, but spying has been a staple in fiction writing for decades. Both non-spies and former intel officers have crafted spy thrillers that have won critical and popular praise. What are the differences between writing spy novels with or without previous intelligence experience? What are the challenges of writing realistic spy fiction? How much creative license is needed to make it exciting? How much realism is sacrificed in the process? How do real life spies react to spy fiction? How different is their response to that of the broader public?

Join the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security as senior fellow David Priess talked with critically acclaimed authors Alma Katsu, Karen Cleveland, and Brad Thor about spy writing in the real world and about their exciting new novels.

Award-winning author Alma Katsu  a former CIA and NSA analyst, has written five novels prior to RED WIDOW, her first spy novel, which was named in March a NY Times Editor's Choice and is in development for a TV series with FOX.

Karen Cleveland is a former CIA analyst and the New York Times bestselling author of NEED TO KNOW and KEEP YOU CLOSE. Her third novel, YOU CAN RUN, will be published in August.

Brad Thor is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of 21 thrillers. His newest, BLACK ICE, continues the adventures of Scot Harvath, America’s top spy, will be published June 22nd.

Who will be the targets of the intelligence community in the coming years? Will China be the top intelligence priority? Will terrorism remain an issue on the IC’s agenda? How will it approach non-traditional challenges like climate change? What technology will the IC use? How might America’s adversaries take advantage of these developments? Where will the intelligence community find talent? How will it ensure it has the people it needs in a competitive labor market?

To answer these questions and more, the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security is pleased to present a panel of distinguished intelligence leaders. Hayden Center senior fellow, and former deputy and acting CIA Director, Michael Morell  moderates a discussion featuring former CIA director John Brennan; Robert Cardillo, former Deputy Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; and former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Susan Gordon.

Is conflict inevitable between a declining superpower in the United States and a rising one in China? Or has China’s power peaked? If it has, does that make Beijing more or less dangerous? What if Beijing’s approach is more cautious than its actions sometimes appear? Could responses to what seem like provocations raise the risk of conflict?

The Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security welcomes a distinguished panel of experts on U.S.-China relations to address these questions. Graham Allison is the Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard University. His most recent book is ""Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?"".

It argues that a more fitting epitaph for the literature from intelligence history's earliest days is better designated as the ‘Muckraker Era’, rather than the ‘airport bookstall’. My argument proceeds on three fronts. First, these writers from the latter half of the twentieth century – rather than being cast out as pariahs – should be thought of as trailblazers, as many of the techniques they pioneered have formed the methodological backbone of historical research into intelligence. Second, the literature from this period, triangulated with recent scholarship, should be re-examined, as precious practical contributions can be identified. Lastly, throughout the article I will attempt to recast the literature from this period, offering a new more constructive perspective that is in keeping with the ethos of today's professional historian. My argument focuses on the works of three authors – Rebecca West, Gordon Brook-Shepherd and John Bulloch – as emblematic authors of the Muckraker Era, in methods, contribution and the indifference of subsequent intelligence scholars to their work.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E77TAFFR,2017,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Jules', 'lastName': 'Gaspard'}]",,History,author,Jules,Gaspard,

The recent digitalisation of secret records of conversations between German prisoners of war, made by British intelligence, enables computer-based research on that topic. This article will analyse various statements from around 400 German soldiers concerning their intelligence system, its organisation and usefulness. They each perceived the organisation and personnel of the German system in different ways depending on personal experience. Collection methods were widely discussed and in the case of the use of force during interrogation situations criticised. The analysis of raw material and the link between intelligence and its use in battle can be found to a lesser extent. Although German prisoners mentioned successful applications of intelligence within combat situations enthusiastic comments increasingly diminished during the course of the war. In addition, a growing awareness of a functioning British intelligence system can be detected. The appreciation of the significance of intelligence and its use in combat remained very limited.

Yet, despite its successful work and the realisation throughout Whitehall that economic intelligence would be needed after the war, Enemy Branch was wound down even before the conflict was over. This article seeks to answer the puzzling question of Enemy Branch's demise while the rest of the intelligence community continued to prosper. It puts the demise of Enemy Branch into the context of the ‘Cold War in Whitehall’, the quarrel between the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff over British post-war policies towards the Soviet Union. The Foreign Office briefly took over Enemy Branch in the last year of the war to use its expertise in order to run the Economic and Industrial Planning Staff, but it had no long-term interest in this economic intelligence organisation. The military, on the other hand, had long-term needs for economic intelligence, but was loath to partake in an inter-departmental economic intelligence organisation, particularly when it was controlled by the Foreign Office.

US intelligence also noted the extensive recruitment of Japanese intelligence networks and operators to serve the Soviets, the KMT regime and the Communist Party of China (CPC); only a couple of years earlier Japanese spies were the enemy, and now they were deemed expert intelligence assets, to be employed without hesitation.

Seth, as Agent Blunderhead, was parachuted into German-occupied Estonia late in 1942 to destroy the country’s vital shale oil plants. Upon landing, Seth was swiftly captured and offered to work for the Germans as a double agent. In April 1945, Seth was sent over the German border into Switzerland as SD Agent 22D, where he promptly presented the British with sensational peace terms from Himmler. This article presents the British security services’ remarkable conclusions and indicates that, in their opinion, Seth was ‘spiritually so much under German domination that he intends to work for an Anglo-German understanding and an anti-Russian policy after the war’, had ‘not told us all about the services he rendered to the Germans’, was of ‘unbalanced character and rabidly anti-Soviet’, ‘extremely untruthful’, prone to ‘megalomania’ and that ‘neither his loyalty to this country nor his discretion were all that could be desired’. Seth was also considered to be a post-war security threat whose job opportunities should be restricted. Despite these revelations, Seth was never prosecuted and was able to become a successful post-war espionage author.

They also offer new insights into the operations and achievements of the Germany army’s early espionage activities. Up until now, little has been known about these years since all of the relevant archival material was thought to have been destroyed in April 1945. So for the first time, this study is able to tell the closely linked tales of these early German intelligence operations and how they were monitored and used by the diplomats in Berlin.

Born from revolutionary crisis in the late 1920s, the Red Army’s SIGINT service was founded in 1931, an offshoot of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s development of wireless communications. Though the USSR provided some training assistance, the formative early development of the service relied more on indigenous resources: the training of teenage novices in underground facilities in Shanghai and the Central Soviet and the use of equipment that was self-made, illicitly procured or seized on the battlefield. In the years that followed, Red Army SIGINT – much respected by CCP/Red Army leaders – survived defections and cryptographic obstacles to play a major role in the defence of the Central Soviet against Guomindang encirclement.

The measures of effect entailed data gathering by polling and surveying the 30 million recipients of the propaganda effort through television commercials, radio broadcasts, newspaper editorials and street billboards.

Shortly after his arrival in Sweden in June 1944, however, Blankenfelds got in touch with the British diplomatic mission in Stockholm, told them of his assignment and became a double agent, maintaining contacts with the Germans while continually providing information to the British, who in turn kept the Swedish police informed. Blankenfelds was later arrested and interrogated by the Swedes and, when released, agreed to provide them with information as well. He thereby significantly contributed to the arrest and extradition of a German agent in Sweden – the Head of the German tourist agency in Sweden, Baron Bernd von Gossler. Blankenfelds’ assignment to America was repeatedly delayed throughout the autumn of 1944 and by late October, Berlin ordered the mission to be called off altogether.

Throughout the war, the government of William Morris Hughes had been engaged in a bitter conflict with radicals, trade unions, Irish nationalists, and members of the Labor Party over implementing the policy of military conscription. Twice the issue was put to the Australian people in a referendum, and twice it was defeated. The Hughes government saw this defeat partly as the result of the anti-conscription movement. Consequently, it had no scruples in using the intelligence services to suppress its political enemies. Within this context, this paper looks at how intelligence, throughout the conscription campaigns, became a means of suppressing political opposition and dissent. It discusses the government’s rationale for such behaviour and offers an assessment of the circumambient conditions that enabled intelligence to be used for political gain.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/N4BUK5B9,"January 2, 2017","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Justin T.', 'lastName': 'McPhee'}]",,Journal of Intelligence History,author,Justin T.,McPhee,

Firstly, it will analyse structural features of the UK and US Intelligence Communities, explaining how the organisation can affect the accuracy of the assessments. Secondly, it will focus on the analytical breakdowns occurred in the 2002 process of assessment. Thirdly, it will address the issue of politicisation, in both its forms of political pressure and political representation of the perceived truth. Finally, it will argue that, although the analysis was undoubtedly flawed, the politicisation played a major role in the failure of the 2002 assessments.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BBXBFQHD,"January 2, 2018","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Giovanni', 'lastName': 'Coletta'}]",,Journal of Intelligence History,author,Giovanni,Coletta,

A large number of academic studies on WWII covert operations focused on allied covert operations and not many had evaluated the strategic effectiveness of Japanese covert operations. One such Japanese unit was the Fujiwara Kikan or F. Kikan which was formed to support the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore. This article describes F. Kikan’s activities and evaluates its strategic effectiveness. Although there were some arguments that F. Kikan’s successes had been squandered by the too traditional-thinking military leadership that mistrusted covert operations, this article argues that F.

U.S. intelligence agencies initiated covert operations that were designed not only to influence this key group but also to set up clandestine personnel pools for paramilitary action. The core of this endeavor was their cooperation with former Waffen-SS general Felix Steiner and the founding of the ‘Gesellschaft für Wehrkunde’ (GfW), a network of ex-officers that was dedicated to defense studies. This organization quickly developed into an important propaganda tool and a military think tank. After U.S. intelligence terminated its support, the German Federal Government took over GfW and used it as a means to establishing the West German armed forces.

Women working for the intelligence services had to counter workplace discrimination just like any other female employee in more ordinary jobs.

Academic research has shown that decisions benefit from assessments and advice based upon differing points of view. Devil’s advocacy, which criticizes established positions, and offers alternative perspectives to any given argument based upon the same inputs, is one established instrument to try to achieve this. The paper explores analytical lessons learned within the Israeli military system as a result of the Yom Kippur war of 1973. The unexpected outbreak of war showed the urgent need for improvements in assessment and decision-making processes. A ‘devil’s advocate shop’ was subsequently set up within Israeli military intelligence. The prolonged Israeli experience with devil’s advocacy might serve its purpose in the virtual world.

First, the nature of historic accelerated weapon programs is studied, so that common elements and indicators can be developed. An analytical framework based upon the generalized way in which all ‘crash’ programs are run is then constructed. With this analytical framework, when some aspect of a program are uncovered, inferences to aspects which have not yet been observed can be drawn. Using this approach for uncovering ‘crash’ programs implies however a new partnership between collectors and analysts. A strategy to search for ‘crash’ programs is constructed in order to focus the collection and analytical energy on the problem of looking for such a program. This approach is three-stepped. The strategy uses an initial step of understanding the adversary’s perceptions to guide the search to the industrial sectors most likely to harbor such a program. A second step uses a search of that industrial sector for change which would point to specific activities and locations. And finally, detailed analysis and collection focused against the specific facilities uncover details that lead to the truth.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T38GE676,"January 2, 2021","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Danny', 'lastName': 'Pronk'}]",,Journal of Intelligence History,author,Danny,Pronk,

Swedish intelligence learnt that for truly important intelligence reporting, in particular that which signified paradigm shifts, the conclusions had to be presented in a manner that had an impact, in an oral briefing. Moreover, the briefer must be prepared to defend the service’s conclusions. Hence, a keyword in the analyst-policy maker relationship was trust.

This paper begins to fill this gap by providing a detailed history of the early years of military intelligence within what is today probably the most capable Arab military – the Armed Forces of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It describes military intelligence developments between 1965 and 1974 within the Abu Dhabi Defence Force, which was the direct predecessor of the present-day UAE Armed Forces. It concludes with the formation of the entity which is now known as the Directorate of Military Intelligence. The paper is based on archival documents and interviews with those who served in Abu Dhabi’s military intelligence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6ZMDB4F8,"July 3, 2021","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Athol', 'lastName': 'Yates'}]",,Journal of Intelligence History,author,Athol,Yates,

They concluded that an invasion by regular Arab armies in response to a declaration of a Jewish state would be a ‘low probability’ and that Arab propaganda calling for the destruction of Israel only amounted to a war of nerves. Today it is abundantly clear that the intelligence agencies failed to weigh these factors correctly. In fact, what primarily motivated the Arab regimes to launch an all-out war was indeed their internal and external situation, since by so doing they could divert public attention away from their internal problems and ameliorate their external status.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/X5KFWTMM,"July 3, 2021","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Yoram', 'lastName': 'Fried'}]",,Journal of Intelligence History,author,Yoram,Fried,

The purpose of this article is to revise the commonly accepted narrative on two American-sponsored émigré operations, showing how they should be assessed as intelligence collection ventures rather than covert operations, and to demonstrate how these émigrés played a key role in providing intelligence on the Soviet target.The study will also investigate how this kind of covert action tied into US policy-making, and how the perceived needs of the US administration – chiefly creating an ‘early warning’ system for a Soviet attack on Europe and the need of information on the Soviet target – shaped intelligence collection in the early Cold War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q5TTH3TP,"July 3, 2021","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Francesco Alexander', 'lastName': 'Cacciatore'}]",,Journal of Intelligence History,author,Francesco Alexander,Cacciatore,

The service responded in various ways to a changing landscape engendered by military occupation, overseas deployment, geographical distance, enemy activity, and imminent defeat.

By reconstructing a multidimensional story that focuses on both the impact of the Soviet Union on the end of the Portuguese Empire in Africa and the effect of the anticolonial struggles on the Soviet Union, Natalia Telepneva bridges the gap between the narratives of individual anticolonial movements and those of superpower rivalry in sub-Saharan Africa during the Cold War.  
 
Drawing on newly available archival sources from Russia and Eastern Europe and interviews with key participants, Telepneva emphasizes the agency of African liberation leaders who enlisted the superpower into their movements via their relationships with middle-ranking members of the Soviet bureaucracy. These administrators had considerable scope to shape policies in the Portuguese colonies which in turn increased the Soviet commitment to decolonization in the wider region. An innovative reinterpretation of the relationships forged between African revolutionaries and the countries of the Warsaw Pact, Cold War Liberation is a bold addition to debates about policy-making in the Global South during the Cold War.

Schelling salience refers to how certain aspects can spontaneously and tacitly become collectively cognitively prominent, and thus, coordinate behavior. Short-term benefits of a predominant mindset may generate long-term biases in analysis, collection, and decisionmakers’ responsiveness. Strong mindsets do not inevitably generate intelligence failures. However, a particular organizational state, referred to as a “pleasant attractor,” where sustained strategies produce satisficing outcomes and alternative strategies are more uncertain and/or costly, is conducive to biased mindsets causing intelligence failures.

These, in turn, reflected a more fundamental and ongoing transformation in that relationship arising from “revolution in military affairs” during the 1990s.

This is demonstrated by applying info-gap decision theory and the concept of robust-satisficing to the analysis of policy in response to al-Qaeda prior to 11 September 2001, which illustrates the combination of topical and decision-theoretic expertise.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YPAVJ9IR,"January 2, 2022","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Yakov', 'lastName': 'Ben-Haim'}]",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,author,Yakov,Ben-Haim,

Interpretations range from the assertion of his biographer that he did essentially nothing illegal to the more recent claim that the technical information he provided to the Imperial Navy helped make the Pearl Harbor attack possible. This article uses recently declassified American documents and Japanese sources to shed new light on Rutland’s activities, his role in the wider Japanese intelligence apparatus, and the nature of his mission. Contra most previous analyses, these suggest that the Japanese Navy viewed Rutland as an agent with future potential for wartime rather than one who had already provided valuable services. Those included creating close relationships with high-profile Americans to get strategic information rather than technical intelligence. They also suggest that the Japanese Navy’s skewed view of Rutland prevented it from developing a more effective prewar intelligence network, with dire consequences.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7EC3U5Q6,"January 2, 2022","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ron', 'lastName': 'Drabkin'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Bradley W.', 'lastName': 'Hart'}]",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,author,Ron,Drabkin,

Under cover of diplomatic recognition, trade agreements, and local communist parties, Soviets sent numerous clandestine agents abroad to pursue national security objectives, including theft of military and industrial secrets on a large scale. France, Britain, and the United States were the main targets in which, organizationally, Soviet intelligence used a consistent pattern. As an existential threat, France was the first priority until displaced by the fear of German rearmament. France represented a rich resource for advanced military and industrial technology that the Soviets needed to transform Russia’s infrastructure. In 1935, France and Russia signed a mutual defense pact that effectively ended Soviet espionage in France.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/AUVN5L7Z,"January 2, 2022","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'William T.', 'lastName': 'Murphy'}]",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,author,William T.,Murphy,

Equipped with these advanced intellectual achievements, Soviet special services secured their status as the Kremlin’s principal strategic tool, exalted over the military. By drawing on new discoveries from the former Soviet archives and a thorough rereading of secondary sources, this article discusses this phenomenon and its implications in both Soviet and post- Soviet times, and distils theoretical lessons for Strategic Culture theory.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7Y65G5JB,"January 2, 2022","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Yaacov', 'lastName': 'Falkov'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Yaacov,Falkov,

In multilateral discussions about norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, digital political espionage is the elephant in the room. Like other aspects of inter-state intelligence competition, digital espionage is ‘business as usual’ but can also lead to tensions, particularly when operations become public. The strategic consequences of digital espionage appear significant, as asymmetries of state power and poor understanding of technical aspects of cyber operations lead to uncertainty about appropriate responses to ‘cyber victimhood’. We offer multiple propositions to frame state responses to digital espionage, focusing on the relational power of the victim and spying states and their bilateral relationships. States will generally respond proportionately to state-on-state digital espionage, whilst domestic-political factors pressure them to adopt more robust, cost-imposing measures that may exacerbate the strategic consequences of digital espionage. We illustrate these propositions with three recent cases – the Snowden revelations (2013); the Office of Personnel Management breach (2014); and the SolarWinds breach (2020) – and explore the importance of calibrated responses to digital political espionage for strategic stability and state behavioural norms in cyberspace.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BRIL5EXJ,"September 2, 2021","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Joe', 'lastName': 'Devanny'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ciaran', 'lastName': 'Martin'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Tim', 'lastName': 'Stevens'}]",,Journal of Cyber Policy,author,Joe,Devanny,

Long before the inception of SIS and the CIA, in the period of the Renaissance, the Republic of Venice had masterminded a remarkable centrally-organised state intelligence organisation that played a pivotal role in the defence of the Venetian empire. Housed in the imposing Doge's Palace and under the direction of the Council of Ten, the notorious governmental committee that acted as Venice's spy chiefs, this 'proto-modern' organisation served prominent intelligence functions including operations (intelligence and covert action), analysis, cryptography and steganography, cryptanalysis, and even the development of lethal substances. Official informants and amateur spies were shipped across Europe, Anatolia, and Northern Africa, conducting Venice's stealthy intelligence operations. Revealing a plethora of secrets, their keepers, and their seekers, Venice's Secret Service explores the social and managerial processes that enabled their existence and that furnished the foundation for an extraordinary intelligence organisation created by one of the early modern world's most cosmopolitan states.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Z4QXCL45,2019,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ioanna', 'lastName': 'Iordanou'}]",Oxford University Press,,author,Ioanna,Iordanou,

816,"Espionage in the 16th century Mediterranean: secret diplomacy, Mediterranean go-betweens and the Ottoman-Habsburg rivalry",Thesis,https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/557617,"Spies played a crucial role in early modern imperial rivalries. While past scholars have emphasized the Islam/Christendom divide in the Mediterranean, these go-betweens, who mastered the codes of both cultures, easily crossed invisible boundaries between civilizations and connected the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, two imperial powers at each other's throat. Apart from providing both empires with regular information on political and military developments, these entrepreneur information brokers played an active diplomatic role between two capitals and even participated in Ottoman factional politics.
 
This dissertation compares both empires' secret services and explains the differences between the two systems of information gathering based on these empires' differing organizational structures. It argues that the Habsburgs tried to institutionalize and standardize their secret services in accordance with their general efforts of bureaucratization and centralization, even though the effect of such efforts remained rather limited in the Levant. The Ottomans, on the other hand, maintained their longstanding decentralized approach and delegated the responsibility of gathering information to pashas and court favourites who established their own intelligence networks. This created a rather different situation whereby these networks served their masters's interests rather than that of the state, thus giving the historian ample information on Ottoman factional politics. In relying on oral communication and not following the recent developments in steganography and cryptography, the Ottoman secret service was more personal than institutional.
 
Still, the Ottoman secret service produced good results. In spite of these differences that could have been otherwise considered shortcomings and contrary to the unwarranted assumptions that prevailed in Western historiography, the Ottomans successfully developed a functional information gathering mechanism which in itself was coherent. The real factor that negatively affected the efficiency of both empires was the lack of direct diplomacy between two capitals. While both empires kept themselves informed of political developments and military preparations, they failed to develop an awareness of each other's legal, political and economic systems as well as cultural, linguistic and religious particularities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MHW8I5BK,2012,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Emrah Safa', 'lastName': 'Gurkan'}]",,,author,Emrah Safa,Gurkan,

Working in real-time across these states to create a common picture of the threat environment and harmonized security and regulatory approaches would benefit defensive information space security efforts, as well as make the private sector a more effective and accountable security partner in the information space. Echoing the impassioned foresight of Winston Churchill, whose invocation to common cause shaped a political balance of power for three generations, this paper argues that the contemporary Five Eyes community would see fundamental benefits in uniting against a modern scourge of disinformation along the lines of classified information exchange models dating back nearly a century. This issue brief recommends steps toward a common regulatory environment for information platforms, greater civic defense, individual education, rapid liaison information exchange, adoption of existing best practices, and greater resources toward international research to support and refine electoral laws against evolving threats.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BEKYHLCR,2021-05-10T14:30:00+00:00,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Daniel', 'lastName': 'Dobrowolski'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'David', 'lastName': 'Gioe'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Trey', 'lastName': 'Herr'}]",,,author,Daniel,Dobrowolski,

The combination of unequal socioeconomic structures, an authoritarian political culture, and uncooperative political dynamics explain such imbalances. During the Military Dictatorship (1964–1985), the National Information Service (SNI) was effective against those opposing the regime. The New Republic (1985–2014) tried to overcome its legacy. In 1990, the SNI was closed down. In the first decade after the Cold War, security reforms lingered. The National Congress established the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) in 1999. Over two decades, the Brazilian Intelligence System (SISBIN) expanded to 42 leading agencies. Legislative oversight developed slowly and narrowly focused on ABIN. Although prone to various crises, Brazil was able to keep the trilemma democracy, security, and development in precarious equilibrium. Tight reelection for Dilma Rousseff (PT) in 2014 marked a new prolonged economic crisis and bitterly polarized politics in Brazil. Under Bolsonaro, there is concern about the military tutelage, undue politicization of law enforcement and security, and insufficient legislative oversight. Legitimacy in the security realm depends on analytical integrity, robust accountability, and clear operational rules and limits.

The Danubian theatre, one of the crucial scenes of the war, witnessed both belligerents trying to discover the other's activities and planned operations. As they were inhabited by cosmopolitan and heterogeneous populations, Dobruca (Dobruja) and Bessarabia were the most convenient places for both parties to gather military intelligence. The Ottomans acquired information via the Wallachians and the Cossacks, as well as by diplomatic missions and various merchants. The Ottoman Empire's Orthodox Christian subjects – the Bulgarians and Greeks – assisted Russia in gathering information from the right bank of the Danube. Some of these reports were unreliable, as were the spies themselves. The Russian and Ottoman archives have rich resources related to military intelligence, which is an understudied aspect of the Crimean War. Relying upon the archival sources, this paper aims to discuss an entirely ignored topic: the espionage activities in the Balkan theatre during the Crimean War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZQU8TXLG,"March 4, 2014","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'İbrahim', 'lastName': 'Köremezli'}]",,Middle Eastern Studies,author,İbrahim,Köremezli,

(http://www.bcmh.org.uk/event/call-for-papers-bcmh-new-researchers-conference-26-27-november-2021/) Abstract:The use of intelligence is always considered crucial during times of crisis and war. A small crisis in Taba (Egypt), suddenly erupted in early 1906 owing to a border dispute in the Sinai Peninsula, presents a good case where intelligence played an important role. During the crisis and its aftermath, the option of forcing the Dardanelles Straits to coerce the Ottomans was proposed and discussed in Whitehall. However, such a scheme was rejected by the Committee of Imperial Defence following a joint study by the intelligence and fighting departments. The main reason for the proposal being rejected is intelligence that had been collected since the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875-78. Recently established military and naval intelligence services had compiled information and produced regular reports that demonstrated how Turkish defences had been strengthened following the defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 and thus put forward the risks of forcing the Straits. Taba Crisis demonstrates how intelligence was successfully used in a crisis and impacted the government’s decision-making. The Crisis is also important as it led the way the last important assessment on the Dardanelles before the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915 being made. What makes it more significant is the fact that British military and political figures who would also be in similar positions in 1915 were involved in discussions in 1906-7. This case also supports the argument that British intelligence services were actually effective and produced regular intelligence reports before the foundation of Secret Service Bureau, the predecessor of MI6.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3U6J9CPE,2021/11/29,"[{'creatorType': 'presenter', 'firstName': 'Yusuf Ali', 'lastName': 'Ozkan'}]",,,presenter,Yusuf Ali,Ozkan,

This partly reflects case-specific methodological challenges, tackled here through multiple overseas sources, but also the relative absence of research on intelligence and security communities in the Global South more generally. Approaching this lacunae head on, this article draws on security assistance literature related to ‘patron-client relations’ and ‘principal-agent’ theory to trace the nature and impact of limited British security assistance pre-independence, before demonstrating how and why significant change characterised Tanzania’s increasingly politicised and unstable security sector and its key international liaison partners post-independence. These changes would quickly end British hopes of integrating Tanzania into a ‘Commonwealth security culture’ of friendly post-colonial states, with Tanzania charting its own non-aligned path through a competition of Cold War patrons.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/L6G6GQN5,"January 2, 2021","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Thomas J.', 'lastName': 'Maguire'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Hannah', 'lastName': 'Franklin'}]",,The International History Review,author,Thomas J.,Maguire,

While the intelligence and security agencies are themselves exempt from the Act, releasing only such archival material into the public domain as they see fit, the article will argue that this does not mean that FOI cannot be used productively in this area. Rather, by adopting a wider definition of ‘intelligence’, as advocated by Wesley K. Wark in this journal in 1992, FOI can be used as part of a broader research strategy to secure the release of information that allows the archival study of intelligence to move beyond the material released by the agencies themselves. The article will illustrate this point by drawing on relevant examples of successful FOI requests, while also highlighting some of the related practical challenges and limitations that its use has revealed.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RSXZGLFQ,2014/03,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Christopher J.', 'lastName': 'Murphy'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Daniel W.

Once neglected in academia, the subject is now increasingly firmly established in British and American universities. Common interest in understanding the value as well as the limitations of intelligence nevertheless disguises differing epistemological foundations. Until the late 1980s official British attitudes to secrecy, including opposition to any form of public accountability, inhibited and distorted public understanding. The last two decades have seen changing attitudes to both archival disclosure and parliamentary accountability, though the significance of these is contested. This article outlines these changes as well as how various authors have used various sources to represent the secret world. Two specific areas are explored: covert action and the joint intelligence machinery. The former presents particularly interesting challenges to academic and public scrutiny (in some contrast to the United States) while the latter has received unprecedented illumination in the wake of the failure to discover weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

The utility of supply-side counts varies predictably based upon the underlying distribution of users. Yet, the likelihood of each distribution type varies inversely with its utility: uniform distributions are most useful for intelligence purposes but least likely and power law distributions are least useful but occur most commonly.

The global surveillance disclosures initiated by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have increased public and academic discussions about big data and national security.

To fill this gap, we explain the core characteristics of big data, provide an overview of the techniques and methods of data analytics, and explore how big data can support the core national security process of intelligence. Big data is not only defined by the volume of data but also by their velocity, variety and issues of veracity. Scientists have developed a number of techniques to extract information from big data and support national security practices. We find that data analytics tools contribute to and influence all the core intelligence functions in the contemporary US national security apparatus.

Dataism, as this conviction is called, is so successful because masses of people -- naively or unwittingly -- trust their personal information to corporate platforms. The notion of trust becomes more problematic because people's faith is extended to other public institutions (e.g. academic research and law enforcement) that handle their (meta)data.

Of late, progress in this space has increasingly become associated with software that can expand our ability to gather, filter, interrelate and manipulate data through automated processes. The trend towards automation is both innovative and necessary. However, techno-centric efforts to replace human analysts with finely crafted algorithms across the board, from collection to synthesis and analysis of information, risk limiting the potential of OSINT rather than increasing its scope and impact. Effective OSINT systems must be carefully designed to facilitate complementarity, exploit the strengths, and mitigate the weaknesses of both human analysts and software solutions, obtaining the best contribution from both.

Recognition of these pressures led GCHQ to begin a wide-ranging change programme in the late 1990s. It included not only technology but also deep change in business processes, leadership and culture. A critically important feature of these changes has been the adoption, and when necessary adaptation, of a wide range of management techniques taken from the private sector.

For most of the war British intelligence pursued this joint strategy of covert activity and official collaboration, and MI5 and SIS shared responsibility for Ireland.

916,"Disrupt and Deny: Spies, Special Forces, and the Secret Pursuit of British Foreign Policy",Book,,"British leaders use spies and Special Forces to interfere in the affairs of others discreetly and deniably. Since 1945, MI6 has spread misinformation designed to divide and discredit targets from the Middle East to Eastern Europe and Northern Ireland. It has instigated whispering campaigns and planted false evidence on officials working behind the Iron Curtain, tried to foment revolution in Albania, blown up ships to prevent the passage of refugees to Israel, and secretly funnelled aid to insurgents in Afghanistan and dissidents in Poland. MI6 has launched cultural and economic warfare against Iceland and Czechoslovakia. It has tried to instigate coups in Congo, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and elsewhere. Through bribery and blackmail, Britain has rigged elections as colonies moved to independence. Britain has fought secret wars in Yemen, Indonesia, and Oman — and discreetly used Special Forces to eliminate enemies from colonial Malaya to Libya during the Arab Spring.   This is covert action: a vital, though controversial, tool of statecraft and perhaps the most sensitive of all government activity. If used wisely, it can play an important role in pursuing national interests in a dangerous world. If used poorly, it can cause political scandal — or worse.   In Disrupt and Deny, Rory Cormac tells the remarkable true story of Britain's secret scheming against its enemies, as well as its friends; of intrigue and manoeuvring within the darkest corridors of Whitehall, where officials fought to maintain control of this most sensitive and seductive work; and, above all, of Britain's attempt to use smoke and mirrors to mask decline.

For the last four years the United States has directed the full resources of a `national security' approach towards this threat and has emphasized unilateralism. Europe, based on its own past experience of terrorism, has adopted a regulatory approach pursued through multilateralism. These divergences in transatlantic approaches, with potentially major implications for the future of the relationship, have appeared to be mitigated by a revised American strategy of counterterrorism that has emerged during 2005. However, this article contends that while strategic doctrines may change, the more immutable nature of strategic culture will make convergence difficult. This problem will be compounded by the fact that neither Europe nor America have yet addressed the deeper connections between terrorism and the process of globalization.

926,Disruption and deniable interventionism: explaining the appeal of covert action and Special Forces in contemporary British policy,Journal article,,"The United Kingdom has long engaged in covert action. It continues to do so today. Owing to the secrecy involved, however, such activity has consistently been excluded from debates about Britain’s global role, foreign and security policy and military planning: an important lacuna given the controversy, risk, appeal and frequency of covert action. Examining when, how and why covert action is used, this article argues that contemporary covert action has emerged from, and is shaped by, a specific context. First, a gap exists between Britain’s perceived global responsibilities and its actual capabilities; policy elites see covert action as able to resolve, or at least conceal, this. Second, intelligence agencies can shape events proactively, especially at the tactical level, while flexible preventative operations are deemed well suited to the range of fluid threats currently faced. Third, existing Whitehall machinery makes covert action viable. However, current covert action is smaller scale and less provocative today than in the early Cold War; it revolves around ‘disruption’ operations. Despite being absent from the accompanying debates, this role was recognised in the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, which placed intelligence actors at the heart of British thinking.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FHJ5FWRQ,2017,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Rory', 'lastName': 'Cormac'}]",,International Relations,author,Rory,Cormac,

931,Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare,Book,,"This revelatory and dramatic history of disinformation traces the rise of secret organized deception operations from the interwar period to contemporary internet troll farms We live in the age of disinformation--of organized deception. Spy agencies pour vast resources into hacking, leaking, and forging data, often with the goal of weakening the very foundation of liberal democracy: trust in facts. Thomas Rid, a renowned expert on technology and national security, was one of the first to sound the alarm. More than four months before the 2016 election, he warned that Russian military intelligence was ""carefully planning and timing a high-stakes political campaign to disrupt the democratic process. But as crafty as such so-called active measures have become, they are not new. The story of modern disinformation begins with the post-Russian Revolution clash between communism and capitalism, which would come to define the Cold War. In Active Measures, Rid reveals startling intelligence and security secrets from materials written in more than ten languages across several nations, and from interviews with current and former operatives. He exposes the disturbing yet colorful history of professional, organized lying, revealing for the first time some of the century's most significant operations--many of them nearly beyond belief. A White Russian ploy backfires and brings down a New York police commissioner; a KGB-engineered, anti-Semitic hate campaign creeps back across the Iron Curtain; the CIA backs a fake publishing empire, run by a former Wehrmacht U-boat commander, that produces Germany's best jazz magazine. Rid tracks the rise of leaking, and shows how spies began to exploit emerging internet culture many years before WikiLeaks. Finally, he sheds new light on the 2016 election, especially the role of the infamous ""troll farm"" in St. Petersburg as well as a much more harmful attack that unfolded in the shadows. Active Measures takes the reader on a guided tour deep into a vast hall of mirrors old and new, pointing to a future of engineered polarization, more active and less measured--but also offering the tools to cut through the deception.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3IWC79TZ,2020,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Thomas', 'lastName': 'Rid'}]",Macmillan USA,,author,Thomas,Rid,

Since the professionalization of intelligence services in the aftermath of the Second World War, this behaviour has become known as covert action, which—for generations of scholars—has been defined as plausibly deniable intervention in the affairs of others; the sponsor's hand is neither apparent nor acknowledged. We challenge this orthodoxy. By turning the spotlight away from covert action and onto plausible deniability itself, we argue that even in its supposed heyday, the concept was deeply problematic. Changes in technology and the media, combined with the rise of special forces and private military companies, give it even less credibility today. We live in an era of implausible deniability and ambiguous warfare. Paradoxically, this does not spell the end of covert action.

The Egyptians used deception to neutralize two Israeli 'strong points' that might jeopardize the crossing of the Suez Canal: the capacity for a preemptive strike and deployment in strength in the Canal region. The deception aimed to minimize Israel's 'early warning space', delaying the moment of decision-making and slowing down the IDF's operational response. Implementing a dual technique of concealing and misleading, the deception lulled the Israeli early warning system, the linchpin of its security doctrine, into accepting the (wrong) alternative option.

959,Dirty Tricks or Trump Cards: U.S.Covert Action and Counterintelligence,Book,,"Contrary to popular misconceptions and public branding as ""dirty tricks,"" covert action and counterintelligence can have considerable value. Democracies, while wary of these instruments, have benefited significantly from their use, saving lives, treasure, and gaining strategic advantage. As liberal democracies confront the post-Cold War mix of rogue states and non-state actors, such as criminals and terrorists, and weapons of mass destruction and mass disruption, these clandestine arts may prove to be important tools of statecraft, and perhaps trump cards in the twenty-first century.Godson defines covert action as influencing events in other parts of the world without attribution, and counterintelligence as identifying, neutralizing, and exploiting the secret activities of others. Together they provide the capability to resist manipulation and control others to advantage. Counterintelligence protects U.S. military, technological, and diplomatic secrets and turns adversary intelligence to U.S. advantage. Covert action enables the United States to weaken adversaries and to assist allies who may be hampered by open acknowledgment of foreign support.Drawing on contemporary and historical literature, broad-ranging contacts with senior intelligence officials in many countries, as well as his own research and experience as a longtime consultant to the U.S. government, Godson traces the history of U.S. covert action and counterintelligence since 1945, showing that covert action works well when it is part of a well-coordinated policy and when policy makers are committed to succeeding in the long-term. Godson argues that the best counterintelligence is an offensive defense. His exposition of the essential theoretical foundations of both covert action and counterintelligence, supported by historical examples, lays out the ideal conditions for their use, as well as demonstrating why they are so difficult to attain.This book will be of interest to students and general readers interested in political science, national security, foreign policy, and military policy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/EALHT9DF,2000,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Roy', 'lastName': 'Godson'}]",Transaction Publishers,,author,Roy,Godson,

The target's tendency to assimilate discrepant information to existing mental sets generally negates the risks to deception posed by security leaks and uncontrolled channels of information. Cognitive biases in the assessment of probabilities, evaluation of evidence, and attribution of causality are described and related to questions of deception and counterdeception. Approaches to enhancing an organization's ability to detect deception are examined. Improved intelligence collection and heightened alertness to deception are often insufficient.

This article explores issues around how states and non-state actors appropriate civilians’ images to produce intelligence about conflict, critically scrutinizing a practice often called open source or social media intelligence. It argues that image appropriation for open-source intelligence production creates a new kind of visual security paradox in which civilians can be endangered by their everyday visual practices because their digital images can be appropriated by outside actors as conflict intelligence. The transformation of everyday images into conflict evidence relies on what Barthes termed the photographic paradox, the paradox that while a photograph is clearly not the reality it depicts, the photograph is casually interpreted as a copy of that reality. When images are appropriated as conflict intelligence this photographic paradox translates into a security paradox. A visual security argument can be made without the intention or knowledge of the image producer, who then comes to perform the role on an intelligence agent. Yet civilians in warzones can hardly refrain from producing any images when they need to call attention to their plight, and to stay in contact with friends and relatives. The paradox, then, is that such vital visual signs of life can rapidly become sources of danger for the civilian. This civilian visual security paradox, it is argued, demands that intelligence actors respect the protected status of civilians in their online collection practices. So far, however, there is little sign of such respect.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZMRPRFEN,"April 16, 2019","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Rune', 'lastName': 'Saugmann'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Rune,Saugmann,

It does so by considering the impacts of OSINT on three important contemporary security issues: nuclear proliferation, humanitarian crises and terrorism. This edited volume takes a fresh look at the subject of open source intelligence (OSINT), exploring both the opportunities and the challenges that this emergent area offers at the beginning of the twenty-first century. In particular, it explores the new methodologies and approaches that technological advances have engendered, while at the same time considering the risks associated with the pervasive nature of the Internet. Drawing on a diverse range of experience and expertise, the book begins with a number of chapters devoted to exploring the uses and value of OSINT in a general sense, identifying patterns, trends and key areas of debate. The focus of the book then turns to the role and influence of OSINT in three key areas of international security - nuclear proliferation; humanitarian crises; and terrorism. The book offers a timely discussion on the merits and failings of OSINT and provides readers with an insight into the latest and most original research being conducted in this area., ""This new and fresh perspective on Open Source Intelligence should be a primary textbook in intelligence analysis, international security, and information science classes. The value of OSINT is explained and explored through a sequence of provocative chapters that provide fresh insights into new approaches to this distinctive type of intelligence. The substantive discussions of the impact of social media, and the merits and failings of OSINT in the areas of nuclear proliferation, humanitarian crises and terrorism are exceptional additions to the study and application of OSINT. As the authors clearly point out, the accessibility of open source information has 'had a profound effect on the intelligence community' and 'it has been conferred with a new status and legitimacy in recent years.' This book is a great place to start in understanding OSINT's effect, and the factors that contribute to its effectiveness."" - James Breckenridge, Mercyhurst University, USA ""In an age dominated by social media, 'big data' and the Internet, Open Source Intelligence has assumed new significance as an area of study and practice.

Especially neglected has been the fighting provoked by the German offensive in 1940 that cleaved through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and drove Britain off the Continent. This article tackles this gap, analysing the military intelligence/military operations interface on the French side. It assesses the contributions and shortcomings of radio-intercept intelligence, along with intelligence-gathering by air and ground reconnaissance (demonstrating that German air superiority imposed a ‘battle blindness’ on Allied commanders wanting intelligence on approach marches and formation switches more than a dozen kilometres into the German rear). It reveals that frontline infantry raiding – redolent of intelligence-gathering techniques familiar to veterans of 1914–18 trench warfare – was again widely employed. This proved a highly effective recourse, particularly during the positional battles on the Somme, Aisne and Oise in June 1940, filling intelligence gaps left by more technologically sophisticated but more fragile sources. The factors that kept formations fighting so as to inflict significant delays and heavy losses on the German assaults were robust communications networks (to convey operational intelligence fast enough to permit counter-manoeuvres based on it), and the preservation of French chains of command and control. When these key nodes collapsed, preventing the hard-won operational intelligence being deployed to coordinate French military resistance, the latter declined into a series of disjointed, directionless and unavailing acts of courage that could not exploit the several instances during the campaign when the Germans, too, were afflicted by battle fatigue, re-supply bottlenecks and morale wobbles.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/68UXI3PA,"June 1, 2013","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Martin S.', 'lastName': 'Alexander'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Martin S.,Alexander,

It connects the period of the Second World War, dominated by Bletchley Park and Arlington Hall, with the Snowden era. This special section examines signals intelligence in the latter decades of the twentieth century, arguing that the processes of covert interference that were used help us to understand sources and methods in our present times. It examines new material that has emerged in Europe that expands our comprehension of the intelligence co-operation between the United States, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden, focusing on the control of technology corporations, especially Crypto AG. It argues that, as a result of Operation Rubicon, all states with high-grade computing, even the Soviet Union, were probably secret beneficiaries of this process and derived substantial flow of intelligence as a result, mostly from the global south.

One of the key findings is that Sigint became an essential source of intelligence information on both sides of the Iron curtain because of the failings of other intelligence sources, especially Human Intelligence (Humint). It is also apparent that Sigint, together with the reconnaissance satellites operated by the US and the USSR, consistently produced the most reliable intelligence available to consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. After weighing Sigint's successes and failings during the Cold War, the authors also conclude that Sigint's true value as an intelligence source can only be achieved when it is effectively combined with information produced by other intelligence sources into an 'all-source' product.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PT6EHAEL,2001,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Matthew M.', 'lastName': 'Aid'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Cees', 'lastName': 'Wiebes'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Matthew M.,Aid,

The Entente cryptographic services were able to reconstruct most of those codebooks, to obtain copies of others, and to overcome various enhancements introduced by the Germans. A collection of diplomatic and naval attaché cryptograms from and to the German consulate in Genoa, dating from the late 19th Century to 1915, has been preserved and is held in German archives. 1 In this article, the authors describe the process of identifying the encoding methods, of reconstructing diplomatic codebooks, and of recovering the superencipherment applied to the German Navy’s Verkehrsbuch. The vast majority of the messages can now be read in clear. The authors also provide the historical context for the messages, which shed new light on the impact of the mobilization and war declarations on the Genoa consulate, its role in gathering naval intelligence, and in assisting the Goeben and Breslau warships in their escape to the Dardanelles in August 1914. 2",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XGUCQX4Y,"July 9, 2020","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'George', 'lastName': 'Lasry'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ingo', 'lastName': 'Niebel'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Torbjörn', 'lastName': 'Andersson'}]",,Cryptologia,author,George,Lasry,

With a staff of 38,000 people, it dwarfs the CIA in budget, manpower and influence. Recent headlines have linked it to economic espionage throughout Europe and to the ongoing hunt for the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. James Bamford first penetrated the wall of silence surrounding the NSA in 1982, with the much-talked-about US bestseller THE PUZZLE PALACE. In BODY OF SECRETS he offers shocking new details about the inner workings of the agency, gathered through unique access to thousands of internal documents and interviews with current and former officials. Unveiling extremely sensitive information for the first time, Bamford exposes the role the NSA played in numerous Soviet bloc Cold War conflicts and discusses its undercover involvement in the Vietnam War. His investigation into the NSA's technological advances during the last 15 years brings to light a network of global surveillance ranging from on-line listening posts to sophisticated intelligence-gathering satellites. In a hard-hitting conclusion, he warns the NSA is a double-edged sword: while its worldwide eavesdropping activities offer the potential for tracking down terrorists and uncovering nuclear weapons deals, it also has the capacity to listen in on global personal communications.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/S5RV9HEF,2002,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'James', 'lastName': 'Bamford'}]",Arrow,,author,James,Bamford,

1087,"Strategic Warning: If Surprise is Inevitable, What Role for Analysis?",Document,http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA526588,"The dramatic events of 11 September 2001 color this paper, but it is not about the devastating terrorist attacks per se, nor about the daunting challenges of tactical warning. The focus, instead, is on strategic warning. Warning analysis is charged with applying all-source information, expert insights, and specialized tradecraft to help policy officials prevent or limit damage from threats to US security interests. Tactical warning, as defined in this paper, seeks to detect and deter specific threats to US interests; the objective is to avoid incident surprise and thus block or blunt damage. Strategic warning addresses perceived dangers in broader terms, in order to inform policymaker decisions on general security preparedness--again to prevent or limit damage. US national security resources are limited. Tactical warning cannot be counted on to pinpoint defensive measures by providing timely notice of all specific attacks and menacing developments. In this context, the challenge of strategic warning is to help policy officials decide--in advance of specific indicators of danger--which of the many plausible general threats to US security interests deserve concerted defensive and preemptive preparations. Strategic warning, to be effective, has to be credible in assessing contingent dangers and has to facilitate policymaker decision and action to protect against these dangers. This paper tables for consideration and debate several recommendations to advance two goals: (1) To reconstitute strategic warning as a collaborative governmental function by engaging policy officials responsible for effecting defensive measures in every step of the analysis process, including topic selection and trend monitoring; (2) To warrant a distinctive intelligence contribution to a collaborative warning effort by expanding dedicated analytic resources and sharpening requisite substantive expertise and specialized tradecraft.

1092,The Rational Timing of Surprise,Journal article,,"National leaders are frequently surprised by the actions of other governments. This paper explores the structure common to problems involving the use of resources for achieving surprise. Such resources include deception through double agents and through sudden changes in standard operating procedures. Still other resources for surprise include cracked codes, spies, and new weapons. Since surprise is usually possible only by risking the revelation of the means of surprise, in each case the same problem arises: when should the resource be risked and when should it be maintained for a potentially more important event later? A rational-actor model is developed to provide a prescriptive answer to this question. Examining the ways in which actual actors are likely to differ from rational actors leads to several important policy implications. One is that leaders may tend to be overconfident in their ability to predict the actions of their potential opponents just when the stakes get large. Another implication is that, as observational technology improves, the potential for surprise and deception may actually increase.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5S5SSKIP,1979,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Robert', 'lastName': 'Axelrod'}]",,World Politics,author,Robert,Axelrod,

Five cases of failures in intelligence estimates are discussed: (1) the Barbarossa Operation; (2) the attack on Pearl Harbor; (3) the Chinese Intervention in the Korean War; (4) the Sino-Indian Border War of October 1962; (5) the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973.

The 9/11 terrorist attacks provide a good case to study for greater understanding of the influence, or lack of influence, that intelligence analysis has on decision-making.

Far from being a failure of intelligence here is evidence to show that there occurred a failure of response on behalf of key decision-makers.

Betts draws on three decades of work within the U.S. intelligence community to illuminate the paradoxes and problems that frustrate the intelligence process. Unlike America's efforts to improve its defenses against natural disasters, strengthening its strategic assessment capabilities means outwitting crafty enemies who operate beyond U.S. borders. It also requires looking within to the organizational and political dynamics of collecting information and determining its implications for policy. Betts outlines key strategies for better intelligence gathering and assessment. He describes how fixing one malfunction can create another; in what ways expertise can be both a vital tool and a source of error and misjudgment; the pitfalls of always striving for accuracy in intelligence, which in some cases can render it worthless; the danger, though unavoidable, of ""politicizing"" intelligence; and the issue of secrecy& mdash;when it is excessive, when it is insufficient, and how limiting privacy can in fact protect civil liberties. Grounding his arguments in extensive theory and policy analysis, Betts takes a comprehensive and realistic look at the convergence of knowledge and power in facing the intelligence challenges of the twenty-first century.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TU6HRPQB,2007,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'name': 'Richard K.

Since analysis and decision are interactive rather than sequential processes, and authorities often hear but dismiss correct estimates, intelligence failure is inseparable from policy failure.

The assessments seem to have begun as a consequence of a debate within the administration over US Iraq policy in early 2001. The neoconservatives wanted intelligence that would help them argue for regime-change. A WINPAC 'Red Team' analyst analyzed the tubes using the same methodology as 1976's infamous Team B panel, which skewed intelligence to support neoconservative policies. The Red Team analyst erroneously concluded the tubes were for a nuclear program thus countering assessments that they had a non-nuclear purpose. After the attacks of September 11 and President Bush's embrace of regime-change, the Red Team tubes assessment began to become the official position of the Intelligence Community.

Britain was determined to maintain this advantage following victory, but the wartime machinery was uneconomical, unwieldy, and unsuitable for peace. Drawing on oral testimony, international archives, and private papers, Defence Intelligence and the Cold War provides the first history of the hitherto little-known organisation designed to preserve and advance British capability in military and military-related intelligence for the Cold War: the Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB).Headed by General Eisenhower's wartime intelligence man, Major General Kenneth Strong, the JIB was central to the mission to spy on and understand the Soviet Union, and the broader Communist world. It did so from its creation in 1946 to its end in 1964, when it formed a central component of the new Defence Intelligence Staff. This volume reveals hitherto hidden aspects of Britain's mission to map the Soviet Union for nuclear war, the struggle to understand and contain the economies of the USSR, China, and North Korea in peace and during the Korean War, and the urgent challenge to understand the nature and scale of the Soviet bomber and missile threat in the 1950s and 1960s. The JIB's dedicated work in these fields won it the support of some politicians and military men, but the enmity of others who saw the centralised organisation as a threat to traditional military intelligence.

Based on a mass of newly declassified Russian secret intelligence documentation, it reveals the true story of Soviet intelligence from its very beginnings in 1917 right through to the end of the Cold War. Covering both main branches of Soviet espionage - civilian and military - Jonathan Haslam charts the full range of the Soviet intelligence effort and the story of its development:in cryptography, disinformation, special forces, and counter-intelligence.In a tragic irony, an organization that so casually disposed of others critically depended upon the human factor. Due to their lack of expertise and technological know-how, from early on the Soviets were forced to rely heavily on secret agents instead of the more sophisticated code-breaking techniques of other intelligence agencies. But in this they were highly successful, recruiting spy rings such as the infamous 'Cambridge Five' in the 1930s. Had it not been for Soviet espionage againstBritain's code-breaking effort during the Second World War, Stalin might never have won the victory that later enabled him to dominate half of Europe. Similarly, espionage directed at his allies enabled the Soviets to build an atomic bomb earlier than expected and to take calculated risks in post-wardiplomacy, such as his audacious blockade of Berlin which led to the Berlin Airlift.Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956 alienated many of the foreign 'friends' so valued by the Soviet intelligence services. It also made new recruitment of foreign agents much more difficult, as the USSR rapidly lost its glamour and ideological appeal to potential supporters in the West during the 1950s. However, the gap was finally bridged through exploiting greedy and disloyal Western intelligence officers, using blackmail and bribery - and with great success. In fact, it was theultimate irony that the KGB and GRU had never been more effective than when the Soviet Union began to collapse from within.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VMRCXNJF,2015,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Jonathan', 'lastName': 'Haslam'}]","Oxford University Press, Incorporated",,author,Jonathan,Haslam,

Its postwar history—one of limited Japanese power despite growing insight—has also been problematic for national security.In Special Duty Richard J. Samuels dissects the fascinating history of the intelligence community in Japan. Looking at the impact of shifts in the strategic environment, technological change, and past failures, he probes the reasons why Japan has endured such a roller-coaster ride when it comes to intelligence gathering and analysis, and concludes that the ups and downs of the past century—combined with growing uncertainties in the regional security environment—have convinced Japanese leaders of the critical importance of striking balance between power and insight. Using examples of excessive hubris and debilitating bureaucratic competition before the Asia-Pacific War, the unavoidable dependence on US assets and popular sensitivity to security issues after World War II, and the tardy adoption of image-processing and cyber technologies, Samuels' bold book highlights the century-long history of Japan's struggles to develop a fully functioning and effective intelligence capability, and makes clear that Japanese leaders have begun to reinvent their nation's intelligence community.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NVUZFN5A,2019,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Richard J.', 'lastName': 'Samuels'}]",Cornell University Press,,author,Richard J.,Samuels,

Special reference is made to Fatah movement which has been taken up as a case study. The thesis shows that the two main sources of Islam (the Quran and the Sunnah) provided the regulative codes of practice towards intelligence activities. Prophet Muhammad’s intelligence tradition offers the ideal model that the Arab / Islamic paramilitary groups emulate. Referring to the Islamic roots, the research seeks to point out that the hallmarks of the Islamic intelligence concept which emerged from the Quran and Prophet Mohammed’s tradition, became the framework that accommodated ‘Arab / Islamic modern paramilitary intelligence activities’, such as Fatah’s. The thesis uses the modern concept of the intelligence to identify the ancient activities and compares data process within the intelligence cycle. The range of activities is broad: clandestine collection, counterintelligence, analysis and dissemination, and covert action. It also introduces the Arab intelligence tradecraft such as the uses of safe houses, methods of communication, secrecy and concealments...etc. This thesis also aims to correct the perception that Arab intelligence concept developed after the emergence and expansion of the Islamic Empire.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/V6TT2GHM,2009,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Abdulaziz Abdullah', 'lastName': 'Al-Asmari'}]",,,author,Abdulaziz Abdullah,Al-Asmari,

It did so on an inter-service, national level. The thesis examines the creation of the organisation, in the aftermath of the Second World War, exploring what factors and which people supported the creation of the new agency. It then moves on to examine the work of the JIB in several of its key fields of work, namely topography, economics and monitoring the threat from Soviet nuclear forces, before examining some of the JIB’s international connections and how these contributed to its work. It concludes with an examination of how the JIB begat the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS). It argues that the creation of the JIB was an appropriate response to the need to centralise and retrench in the intelligence machinery after the War, but that the organisation, in essence, represented a compromise between those who wanted to fully centralise military (and military-relevant) intelligence and those who wished to preserve service independence. Over the course of its existence it made important contributions to several key areas of policy – including mapping the Soviet Union for nuclear strike planning, the economic containment of the USSR, as well as China and North Korea during the Korean War, and in monitoring the production of Soviet bombers and missiles – before becoming a central component of the new DIS.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/29224HK5,2010,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Huw', 'lastName': 'Dylan'}]",,,author,Huw,Dylan,

Yet two outstanding questions persist: can Egyptian intelligence be reformed? What would intelligence reform entail in the Egyptian context? An examination of historical Egyptian intelligence reforms suggests that ‘reform’ in the Egyptian context usually means greater efficiency and centralization at the expense of public oversight and accountability.

It makes the case that the significance of understanding defence intelligence and DI lies not only in a general lack of illumination but also because DI is subject to and prompts a range of difficulties and challenges that are either especially acute in the defence context or have ramifications for the wider intelligence community that remain to be fully appreciated. Particular attention is given to DI’s remit being divided between Ministry of Defence and national requirements, problems of fixed-sum resourcing an intelligence function with national responsibilities that is subordinate to Departmental spending structures and priorities, fraught positioning of defence intelligence in Departmental line management and, finally, a chronic lack of public or official interest or scrutiny.

After briefly discussing the KGB precedent, I focus on the FSB annual art awards established in 2006. Although these awards include six categories and three prizes per each category plus honorable mentions, due to the length limitations, I focus only on the first prize winners of the literature award (awarded for fiction, nonfiction, and journalism). The key questions I investigate are, first, what kinds of literary works the FSB deems worthy of the first prize and, secondly, what the FSB literary taste conveys about the self-image that it has sought to construct for domestic and international audiences as well as about its strategic orientation. I conclude that the FSB has a predilection for spy fiction based on real historical events and personalities. Some of the first prize winners are biographies and reference books, but the majority can be categorized as historical fiction. Not surprisingly, they depict self-confident and patriotic intelligence officers who ultimately, though not without a lot of effort, overcome the assorted villains: the tsarist officers, the criminal gangs, the corrupt officials and turncoats in contemporary Russia and, last but not least, the CIA operatives. Curiously, though they generally deal with the threat from the West, many FSB-awarded historical novels are set in the Russian Central Asian or Far Eastern regions.

In so doing, we provide direction for IC leaders seeking to improve academia–industry–intelligence partnerships for future planning on intelligence-funded collaborations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PV8YE65B,"September 19, 2019","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Kathleen M.', 'lastName': 'Vogel'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Beverly B.', 'lastName': 'Tyler'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Kathleen M.,Vogel,

The purpose of this approach to intelligence pedagogy is to get participants to think through and work out analytic methods, issues, and potential solutions from first principles and for themselves. Our strategy is to try and fuse training and education learning outcomes, so that students emerge with a technical competence in analytic methods, underpinned by a deeper understanding of the foundations and internal logic shaping those methods. The Iraq Matrix exercise seeks to unpack and examine the nuts and bolts of source evaluation, and to test alternative hypotheses with particular attention to the relationship between the quality of various sources and, the weight of judgements they can or cannot sustain. The ultimate goal is to encourage what is currently fashionably referred to as ‘reflexive practice’, whereby the practitioner reflects critically and self-critically upon how their task works and how they do it, then uses those insights to improve their workplace performance. But not all of our teaching is directed towards practitioners. For those whose aims are scholarly and academic, the aim is to give observers a more visceral understanding of the challenges of the intelligence task they intended to study. Here the intended reflexive practice goal is to encourage an empathy with the workaday challenges facing those in the business of intelligence analysis, and to discourage the observer’s temptation to make facile and simplistic judgements about processes or events.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Z8AEDXNT,"November 10, 2017","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Philip H.

Intelligence officers discern the truth. They gather information - often contradictory or incomplete - and, with it, they build the most accurate possible image of the world. With the stakes at their absolute highest, they must then decide what to do.     In everyday life, you are faced with contradictory, incomplete information, too.

Many scholars and officials believe that these criticisms reflect inappropriate generalizations from a handful of cases, thus producing undue cynicism about the IC's capabilities. Yet there is currently no way to evaluate this claim, because the IC does not systematically assess the accuracy of its estimates. Many scholars and practitioners justify this state of affairs by claiming that assessing estimative accuracy would be impossible, unwise, or both. This article shows how those arguments are generally unfounded. Assessing estimative accuracy is feasible and desirable.

Despite the US government’s investment in training thousands of analysts, there is no solid evidence on how often or why analysts actually use SATs. A survey of 80 analysts and nine follow-up interviews at the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research reveals a simple, but important, truth: implementing the techniques requires training and compelling evidence they will improve analysis. Other factors, most notably the amount of time pressure an analyst experiences, were not significantly related with the use of the techniques despite anecdotal accounts and conjecture from the literature.

As a result, we lack metrics for gauging possible over-shooting—and have no way of knowing when SATs that focus on suppressing one bias (e.g., over-confidence) are triggering the opposing bias (e.g., under-confidence); (2) SATs tacitly assume that problem decomposition (e.g., breaking reasoning into rows and columns of matrices corresponding to hypotheses and evidence) is a sound means of reducing noise in assessments. But no one has ever actually tested whether decomposition is adding or subtracting noise from the analytic process—and there are good reasons for suspecting that decomposition will, on balance, degrade the reliability of analytic judgment.

1245,Conditions for intuitive expertise: a failure to disagree.(Author abstract)(Report),Journal article,,"This article reports on an effort to explore the differences between two approaches to intuition and expertise that are often viewed as conflicting: heuristics and biases (HB) and naturalistic decision making (NDM). Starting from the obvious fact that professional intuition is sometimes marvelous and sometimes flawed, the authors attempt to map the boundary conditions that separate true intuitive skill from overconfident and biased impressions. They conclude that evaluating the likely quality of an intuitive judgment requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the individual's opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment. Subjective experience is not a reliable indicator of judgment accuracy.

1248,Red Team: how to succeed by thinking like the enemy,Book,,"Red teaming. It is a practice as old as the Devil s Advocate, the eleventh-century Vatican official charged with discrediting candidates for sainthood. Today, red teams comprised primarily of fearless skeptics and those assuming the role of saboteurs who seek to better understand the interests, intentions, and capabilities of institutions or potential competitors are used widely in both the public and private sector. Red teaming, including simulations, vulnerability probes, and alternative analyses, helps institutions in competitive environments to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses, challenge assumptions, and anticipate potential threats ahead of the next special operations raid, malicious cyberattack, or corporate merger. But not all red teams are created equal; indeed, some cause more damage than they prevent. In Red Team, national security expert Micah Zenko provides an in-depth investigation into the work of red teams, revealing the best practices, most common pitfalls, and most effective applications of these modern-day Devil s Advocates. The best practices of red teaming can be applied to the CIA, NYPD, or a pharmaceutical company, and executed correctly they can yield impressive results: red teams give businesses an edge over their competition, poke holes in vital intelligence estimates, and troubleshoot dangerous military missions long before boots are on the ground. But red teams are only as good as leaders allow them to be, and Zenko shows not only how to create and empower red teams, but also what to do with the information they produce. Essential reading for business leaders and policymakers alike, Red Team will revolutionize the way organizations think about, exploit, compensate for, and correct their institutional strengths and weaknesses. Drawing on little-known case studies and unprecedented access to elite red teamers in the United States and abroad, Zenko shows how any group from military units to friendly hackers can win by thinking like the enemy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IPM7KNGN,2015,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Micah', 'lastName': 'Zenko'}]",Basic Books,,author,Micah,Zenko,

1254,Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis,Book,,"This book takes the relatively new concept of structured analytic techniques, defines its place in a taxonomy of analytic methods, and moves it a giant leap forward. It describes 50 techniques that are divided into eight categories. There are techniques for: Decomposition and Visualization Idea Generation Scenarios and Indicators Hypothesis Generation and Testing Cause and Effect Challenge Analysis Conflict Management Decision Support Each structured technique involves a step-by-step process that externalizes an individual analyst s thinking in a manner that makes it readily apparent to others, thereby enabling it to be shared, built on, and easily critiqued by others. This structured and transparent process combined with the intuitive input of subject matter experts is expected to reduce the risk of analytic error. Our current high tech, global environment increasingly requires collaboration between analysts with different areas of expertise and analysts representing different organizational perspectives. Structured analytic techniques are the ideal process for guiding the interaction of analysts within a small team or group. Each step in a technique prompts relevant discussion within the team, and such discussion generates and evaluates substantially more divergent information and more new ideas than a team that does not use a structured process. By defining the domain of structured analytic techniques, providing a manual for using and teaching these techniques, and outlining procedures for evaluating and validating these techniques, this book lays a common ground for continuing improvement of how analysis is done. These techniques are especially needed in the field of intelligence analysis where analysts typically deal with incomplete, ambiguous and sometimes deceptive information. However, these practical tools for analysis are also useful in a wide variety of professions including law enforcement, medicine, finance, and business.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/F3SSYEVG,2010,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Richards J.

Policymakers are guilty of politicization if they compel intelligence agencies to alter their conclusions in ways that are politically convenient or psychologically comforting. Intelligence officials are guilty of politicization if they shape their estimates to reflect their own beliefs and preferences. At first glance politicization appears to be an unalloyed hazard: manipulating estimates seems to make bad intelligence inevitable. Nonetheless, some observers argue that under certain circumstances politicization can be a good thing, or at least a necessary risk. Intelligence officials should be willing to take that risk if the alternative means isolating themselves from the policy process and sacrificing any possible influence over policymakers' judgment. They also should be willing to tone down their conclusions on major issues, or withhold estimates on minor ones, in order to avoid offending policymakers. This kind of ‘soft politicization’ does not mean outright pandering, but it does constrain intelligence leaders from being blunt about estimates that are frankly at odds with policy beliefs and preferences. This article evaluates the possible benefits of politicization and tests it against the historical record.

Some forms of politicization are clearly unethical, but politicization is not inherently evil. In fact it is an ethically neutral form of rhetorical discourse which when properly controlled can provide policymakers with additional decision advantage. When viewed through a rhetorical lens, evidence-based purposeful politicization is more objective than inadvertent influence because it does not try to hide where the evidence leads. By decoupling objectivity and neutrality, it becomes clear that taking a stand on the evidence or making a tough recommendation based on professional judgment are not practices that need to be avoided.

First, an ideal intelligence program would take a ‘Goldilocks’ approach, neither relegating intelligence to the fringes (as academia has done in the past) nor elevating it to a degree program (as is the approach at dozens of US colleges and universities). Because US intelligence agencies prefer their candidates for employment to have substantive knowledge of global issues and language skills, a certificate or minor program in intelligence will educate students about intelligence without depriving them of the opportunity to major in a substantive field. Second, an ideal program will involve former professional intelligence officers to a high degree; too many academic programs in intelligence suffer from the metaphorical ‘Bulgaria problem’ in which alleged experts on Bulgaria don’t speak the language, have never been to Bulgaria, and don’t see their lack of experience on Bulgaria as a problem.

The article goes on to discuss the need to ensure that the teaching of intelligence reflects changes in the two fundamental environments in which intelligence must operate, that is, an operational environment no longer marked by the predominance of a closed state peer adversary, and an information and information technology environment reflecting the dramatic changes that have taken place – and continue to take place – in that latter environment. Teaching intelligence in these complex and fluid environments will require a careful balance between addressing intelligence structures, processes, and methods that characterized 20th century intelligence with at least the likelihood that many of those fundamentals will require replacement or significant redefinition to meet twenty-first century needs. In these circumstances, teaching intelligence must mean preparing students to operate within – if not to create – an intelligence of the future.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HGK7MXM4,"November 10, 2017","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'William M.', 'lastName': 'Nolte'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,William M.,Nolte,

Under the constraints of a foreign policy that sought to gradually encourage the government of Sweden to become more pro-allied rather than pro-axis and ‘non-belligerent’, SOE nonetheless entered Sweden with hopes of developing a series of contacts with groups and individuals that could be turned into active resistance if Sweden joined the axis, or if Nazi Germany either invaded or occupied Sweden and the whole of Scandinavia. Once the possibility of an axis invasion of Sweden was decisively dismissed, SOE had to find a different role. In Sweden, the successful development of SOE's intelligence gathering capabilities in the economic sphere, especially in the allied campaign against German iron-ore traffic and ball-bearings, provided the organization with a purpose that definitely took another course when compared to intelligence activities in other regions and countries. With these constraints in view, this article focuses on three major aspects of SOE involvement in Sweden.

Strategic surprise was obtained because the idea that Germany was about to launch a major invasion of Norway was remote from any of the preconceived scenarios about Germany's next move. Germany's achievement of tactical surprise was also aided by bad weather in the North Sea. The main reason for the failure of both Norwegian and British policy-makers to comprehend what the Germans were up to lies in the importance of the ‘mindset’. On both sides of the North Sea the conventional wisdom was that Germany would not attempt an invasion of Norway against the supremacy of British sea power. Hence all incoming information was interpreted in Oslo in the light of the next mindset, namely that only a determined British attempt to take control of the Norwegian coast could trigger an armed German retaliation. In London, incoming intelligence was interpreted so as to conform to the Admiralty's preconceived scenario of a German naval breakout into the North Atlantic.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FRGBL9Y5,"August 1, 2007","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Olav', 'lastName': 'Riste'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Olav,Riste,

An examination of British and French intelligence archival material sheds new light upon perceptions of power and threat afforded by British and French policy-makers keen to maintain political control over their colonial and client states. The paper suggests that despite comprising a multitude of competing agencies, the Fascist services could rely on the work of motivated individuals and on the support of Italian diplomatic representatives overseas. Their ability to establish relations – although short-lived – with Arab nationalist leaders and their intense activities in British colonies, protectorates and mandates generated concern within the British Foreign and Colonial Offices.

MI5 was one of three bodies responsible for the administration of Defence Regulation 18b (DR18b) and as such its power was limited by an inherent system of checks and balances. As others have suggested, the administration of DR18b was full of tension; however, it is now apparent that this tension was a positive feature of the defence regulations and one that protected the individual rather than condemned him.

Britain struggled against a global terrorist campaign which attacked British targets in Palestine, Egypt and the wider Middle East, continental Europe and the United Kingdom. This article refutes claims by other authors that British rule in Palestine failed because of intelligence failure. Intelligence failure was limited, but so were successes. British intelligence produced reasonable assessments on Zionist politics, but could do little to prevent violence without the cooperation of the Jewish Agency. Success was driven by a combination of signals intelligence, secret agents, one key defector, interrogations and intelligence shared by the Jewish Agency. Failure resulted from a weak understanding of the Zionist underground and from lack of cooperation by Agency authorities. Normally Britain's junior partner, the Jewish Agency was, by 1945, struggling against British restrictions on Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine. Its militia, Haganah, turned to cooperation with terrorists. British intelligence predicted that such developments could occur, but failed to identify them as they unfolded. Britain's dependence on Zionist security intelligence was a key vulnerability that never was addressed by policy-makers. The Jewish Agency leveraged its cooperation, applying it to prevent terrorism in Egypt and the United Kingdom, where violent incidents would harm the Zionist cause. It had little reason to prevent terrorism in the key battlegrounds of Palestine or Europe, and so terrorism harmed Britain's will to continue fighting. The root cause of Britain's failure was at the policy level. Despite known weaknesses, government never assessed its own will and ability to uphold restrictions on Zionist immigration, or to fight terrorism, as against the Yishuv's will and ability to struggle against Britain.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BPFD68KV,"May 27, 2014","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Steven', 'lastName': 'Wagner'}]",,The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History,author,Steven,Wagner,

Through an analysis of this operation, codenamed ‘Kitchenmaid’, an assessment will be made of the capabilities and motivations of SOE's Greek section (Force 133); the problem of its cooperation with Greek communist guerrillas in relation to British foreign policy towards Greece; and the strategic and political value of ‘Kitchenmaid’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7ZKJEUE7,"December 1, 2013","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'James', 'lastName': 'Crossland'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,James,Crossland,

The Anglo-Soviet intelligence alliance (1941–45) is considered as an initial plausibility probe of this argument. Evidence is found to support the premise that cooperation between the intelligence services of a democracy and an autocracy is constrained by the absence of the democratic norms of bounded uncertainty and contingent consent. The article concludes with recommendations on how future scholarship can further explore the relationship between regime type and the depth of international intelligence cooperation.,https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8RGPXASQ,"November 2, 2015","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ryan E.', 'lastName': 'Bock'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Ryan E.,Bock,

In many respects it was a remarkable organization. Its wartime iteration was created in haste, ostensibly as a military body but based upon the Security Service's office in Cairo. It evolved into a truly ‘joint’ unit but culturally was closer to the Security Service (MI5) than either the military or the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). SIME changed dramatically as a result of the end of the Second World War: it became the sole responsibility of MI5; local cooperation between MI5 and MI6 was scaled-down and became the focal point of a broader inter-intelligence service dispute in London; and new nationalist threats caught SIME off-balance and eventually undermined its raison d'être. SIME's contrasting wartime and peacetime iterations provide a useful example of how intelligence agencies respond to external pressures. It also provides a window into wider jurisdictional and constitutional conflicts at the heart of the relationship between MI5 and MI6, both during and after the war. Finally SIME shows practitioners what can be achieved under the right stimulus and what can be lost when that stimulus fades.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IFX78I8H,"April 15, 2016","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Roger', 'lastName': 'Arditti'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Roger,Arditti,

Explaining the selective employment of Nazi war criminals by British and American intelligence agencies in occupied Germany,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2019.1705101,"This article reveals for the first time why a Nazi war criminal named Günter Ebeling who was employed by the American Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) in occupied Germany was violently killed by British intelligence officers. Through analysis of hitherto unpublished Intelligence Division documents, it argues that existing debates concerning the post-war employment of Nazi war criminals in occupied Germany have been framed in the wrong light. Discussions concerning security and control, not morality, usually surrounded disputes regarding the employment of Nazis. Close and comparative analysis of Ebeling’s recruitment and ‘dismissal’ with that of several other Nazis demonstrates that hindsight, source limitations and a prevalent case study approach have prevented the identification of common reasoning concerning security and control which surrounded the post-war employment of war criminals in several areas of intelligence work. Indeed, new evidence suggests that the British and American intelligence services employed some Nazi war criminals in post-war Germany as part of a wider strategy of control designed to ensure the security of the occupation and pave the way for a future democratic Germany. Through the analytical prism of security and control, this article provides a synthesis between a multitude of case studies.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/R67LZ54E,"April 15, 2020","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Luke', 'lastName': 'Daly-Groves'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Luke,Daly-Groves,

The work has traditionally been viewed as the official response to critical investigative works on SOE published during the 1950s, combined with the vocal campaign of Dame Irene Ward, who made several calls in the House of Commons for an official account of SOE to be published. Material now available at the Public Record Office reveals that these were not the sole considerations in official minds, nor the most significant, concerning the possibility of publishing such a work. The foreign office was particularly concerned that Britain's contribution to wartime resistance in Europe, exemplified by SOE, was being overshadowed by both soviet propoganda, emphasizing the communist contribution to resistance, and the publicity being given to SOE's American counterpart, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).

It evolved in response to a semi-colonial and collapsing Ottoman state with little military capacity to protect its borders. The TM participated in a number of covert operations to instigate Islamic insurrections in India, Africa, and Russia, and its methods included the killing of Muslim as well as Christian opponents of the CUP government during World War I.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PJD8AJRM,"April 3, 2014","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Yücel', 'lastName': 'Yiğit'}]",,Middle East Critique,author,Yücel,Yiğit,

Seeking to connect an analysis of intelligence liaison with the wider realm of Anglo-American Relations, the book draws on a wide range of interviews and consultations with key actors in both countries. The book is centred around two critical and empirical case studies, focusing on the interactions on the key issues of counterterrorism and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) counter-proliferation. These case studies provide substantive insights into a range of interactions such as 9/11, the 7/7 London bombings, the A.Q.

Drawing on over 60 interviews conducted in the UK and US with prominent decision-makers and practitioners, these issues are examined in the contemporary historical context, with the main focus being on the years 2000-05.

Further, the resulting scale of unfiltered data such a system would produce might serve to overwhelm rather than assist decision-makers. Finally, we conclude that the problems expressed in the Flynn Report should not be traced to the military intelligence apparatus per se, but rather to the inability of US political leadership to map out a clear vision for current operations – both in Afghanistan, and in the counterinsurgency environment in general.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/K7JWSAKE,"August 1, 2012","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Leo', 'lastName': 'Blanken'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Justin', 'lastName': 'Overbaugh'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Leo,Blanken,

Intelligence as a process and product has been strongly promoted by the EU as a useful and necessary tool in the fight against terrorism, radicalization, organized crime and public order problems. A range of agencies has been established that collect, analyze and operationalize intelligence in view of strategically defined security threats. Examples are Europol and Frontex. This article makes an inventory of their roles and competences in the field of intelligence and looks at the list of instruments that encourage the sharing of intelligence between different law enforcement and security agencies. Moreover, it is argued in this article that as intelligence becomes more hybrid and as the EU only holds light powers of oversight on ownership and integrity of data, considerable governance challenges lurk around the corner. As ‘intelligence’ is usually a complex and sensitive product, it often travels outside formal bureaucratic channels, which undermines accountability and transparency of where, how and for what purpose the intelligence was gathered.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T3M4F2JL,"May 4, 2015","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Monica Den', 'lastName': 'Boer'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Monica Den,Boer,

After 9/11 there was a shift from the study of inter-state intelligence to the use of intelligence against non-state actors such as Al Qaeda.

Governments know that foreign fighters can be a threat to both domestic and international security, yet they struggle to prevent would be foreign fighters from leaving their country and track them subsequently. This article seeks to open up the black box of counter-mobilization by examining the ways in which states deal with foreign fighter mobilizations. It argues that there are two main reasons why they may be unable to effectively contain foreign fighter mobilizations. The first is the challenge of inter-state intelligence cooperation due to conflicts of interests between countries. Linked to this are problems in how intelligence is shared. The second reason is the tension, at the domestic level, between collection and prosecution concerns in the investigation of foreign fighter networks. Countering foreign fighting is not the same as countering terrorism, and sometimes the two objectives are in opposition to one another. The article concludes by calling for more research on how states counter foreign fighter mobilizations, particularly focusing on the activities of intelligence, security and police agencies. Counter-mobilization is an important intervening variable that shapes the scale and nature of foreign fighter mobilizations to a greater extent than hitherto reflected in the literature.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/S7ZQFDTT,20/12/2016,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Timothy', 'lastName': 'Holman'}]",,Perspectives on Terrorism,author,Timothy,Holman,

The acrimonious public arguments over subjects such as Iraqi WMD assessments, secret prisons and the interrogation of detainees suggest intense transatlantic discord. Yet improbably, some of those countries that have expressed strident disagreement in public are privately the closest intelligence partners. It is argued here that we can explain this seeming paradox by viewing intelligence co-operation as a rather specialist kind of ‘low politics’ that is focused on practical arrangements. Intelligence is also a fissiparous activity, allowing countries to work together in one area even while they disagree about something else.

Talks with U.S. officials do indeed reward the use of terrorism, tangibly demonstrating that groups can kill innocents and yet become legitimate interlocutors-a reward that is costly both in terms of reducing the prevalence of this tactic worldwide and because it inevitably angers local allies fighting the groups.

1419,Statecraft by Stealth: Secret Intelligence and British Rule in Palestine,Book,,"Britain relied upon secret intelligence operations to rule Mandatory Palestine. Statecraft by Stealth sheds light on a time in history when the murky triad of intelligence, policy, and security supported colonial governance. It emphasizes the role of the Anglo-Zionist partnership, which began during World War I and ended in 1939, when Britain imposed severe limits on Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine. Steven Wagner argues that although the British devoted considerable attention to intelligence gathering and analysis, they never managed to solve the basic contradiction of their rule: a dual commitment to democratic self-government and to the Jewish national home through immigration and settlement. As he deftly shows, Britain's experiment in Palestine shed all pretense of civic order during the Palestinian revolt of 1936–41, when the police authority collapsed and was replaced by a security state, created by army staff intelligence. That shift, Wagner concludes, was rooted in Britain's desire to foster closer ties with Saudi Arabia just before the start of World War II, and thus ended its support of Zionist policy. Statecraft by Stealth takes us behind the scenes of British rule, illuminating the success of the Zionist movement and the failure of the Palestinians to achieve independence. Wagner focuses on four key issues to stake his claim: an examination of the ""intelligence state"" (per Martin Thomas's classic, Empires of Intelligence), the Arab revolt, the role of the Mufti of Jerusalem, and the origins and consequences of Britain's decision to end its support of Zionism.Wagner crafts a superb story of espionage and clandestine policy-making, showing how the British pitted individual communities against each other at particular times, and why.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WFSW2TRY,2019,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Steven B.', 'lastName': 'Wagner'}]",Cornell University Press,,author,Steven B.,Wagner,

As a result, in 1945–46, the three Jewish armed groups in the Mandate, the Haganah, Etzel and Lehi, started a loosely coordinated armed struggle against British rule. Even the moderates in the Jewish Agency rejected their former partner against Hitler, Britain, and used force against it in order to achieve their political goals. This article assesses British intelligence on these developments, and demonstrates that it failed to anticipate or even to understand the threat until the destruction of the King David Hotel. The article demonstrates that these mistakes occurred because British intelligence relied heavily on the intelligence organs of the Jewish Agency itself for intelligence about political threats within Palestine. The article assesses this intelligence failure, and its heavy costs. However, it denies that bad intelligence caused British failures in the Mandate.

Intelligence was fundamental to the security of the country, since it varyingly augmented understrength force, or supported overwhelming force. Intelligence also supported policymakers as issues of governance were debated. It allowed British decision makers to avoid making a decision on self-government during the 1920s and it supported Britain’s failed attempts to introduce a constitution during the 1930s. Intelligence also was crucial to Britain’s relations with the Arab nationalist and Zionist communities. Of particular importance was Britain’s partnership and subsequent war with the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini. This thesis sheds new light on the role of intelligence in British colonial policymaking, the development of the Arab-Zionist conflict, and how Britain failed to manage communal violence.</p> <p>This research offers a new and improved explanation of the origins, unfolding, and defeat of the Palestinian Arab rebellion. British intelligence and policymakers failed to grasp the sophistication of the Palestinian national movement until the mid-1930s, and even then, they focused on clan competition and the politics of ‘notables’. Intelligence and military records explain how British police and military struggled, but ultimately succeeded to suppress and defeat this rebellion. Victory was made possible by innovations within the intelligence and planning staffs, as well as Zionist cooperation.</p> <p>Intelligence shaped policy most clearly at the beginning and end of the period under examination. During 1918-20, the military government was administered by intelligence officers who guaranteed Britain’s future control in Palestine both domestically, and at the League of Nations. In 1939, British policy abandoned its traditional Zionist partners when the need to impose a solution on Palestine coincided with the opportunity, revealed by signals intelligence, to bolster and leverage the influence of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz ibn Sa’ud over the Arab national movement.</p>",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9JN72L3C,2014,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Steven', 'lastName': 'Wagner'}]",,,author,Steven,Wagner,

Holocaust survivors and Jews wishing to escape communism in Eastern Europe flooded the western Zones of occupation in Germany and Austria, while the Zionist movement worked to bring them to Palestine. Illegal immigration to Palestine was the key policy dispute between Britain and the Zionist movement, and a focus for British intelligence. Britain sought both overt and covert means to prevent the boarding of ships at European ports which were destined for Palestine, and even to prevent the entry of Jewish refugees into the American zones. This article highlights Britain's secret intelligence-gathering efforts as well as its covert action aimed to prevent this movement. It highlights a peculiar episode in the ‘special relationship’ between Britain and the United States, during which cooperation and partnership was lacking. British intelligence promoted a rumour that Soviet agents were using Jewish escape lines to penetrate Western Europe and the Middle East in order to persuade American authorities to prevent the movement of Jewish refugees. Instead, this article argues, American intelligence secretly cooperated with the Zionist organizers of the escape routes so to expose Soviet agents. Britain's attempt at deception backfired, and provided effective cover for the movement of hundreds of thousands of Jews during a critical period. Meanwhile its intelligence had dramatically improved, but policymakers failed to reassess Britain's ability to sustain immigration restrictions and the indefinite detention of tens of thousands of illegal migrants.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XS9G8VQU,"September 3, 2014","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Steven', 'lastName': 'Wagner'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Steven,Wagner,

Using the three criteria of counter-intelligence operations: the ability to locate, identify and neutralize a target, it will be shown that within months of his posting to Dublin British intelligence, albeit inadvertently, had located and identified him as passing classified information to Sinn Fein.

1426,The Great Terror: A Reassessment,Book,,"The definitive work on Stalin's purges, Robert Conquest's The Great Terror was universally acclaimed when it first appeared in 1968. Edmund Wilson hailed it as ""the only scrupulous, non-partisan, and adequate book on the subject."" George F. Kennan, writing in The New York Times Book Review, noted that ""one comes away filled with a sense of the relevance and immediacy of old questions."" And Harrison Salisbury called it ""brilliant...not only an odyssey of madness, tragedy, and sadism, but a work of scholarship and literary craftsmanship."" And in recent years it has received equally high praise in the Soviet Union, where it is now consideredthe authority on the period, and has been serialized in Neva, one of their leading periodicals.Of course, when Conquest wrote the original volume two decades ago, he relied heavily on unofficial sources. Now, with the advent of glasnost, an avalanche of new material is available, and Conquest has mined this enormous cache to write a substantially new edition of his classic work. It is remarkable how many of Conquest's most disturbing conclusions have born up under the light of fresh evidence. But Conquest has added enormously to the detail, including hitherto secret information on the three great ""Moscow Trials,"" on the fate of the executed generals, on the methods of obtaining confessions, on the purge of writers and other members of the intelligentsia, on life in the labor camps, and many other key matters.Both a leading Sovietologist and a highly respected poet, Conquest here blends profound research with evocative prose, providing not only an authoritative account of Stalin's purges, but also a compelling and eloquent chronicle of one of this century's most tragic events. A timely revision of a book long out of print, this updated version of Conquest's classic work will interest both readers of the earlier volume and an entirely new generation of readers for whom it has not been readily available.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BQ2DZL3V,1990,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Robert', 'lastName': 'Conquest'}]",Oxford University Press,,author,Robert,Conquest,

However, while for decades, historians were locked in a narrow debate about the degree of central control over the terror process, recent archival research is underpinning new, innovative approaches and opening new perspectives. Historians have begun to explore the roots of the Terror in the heritage of war and mass repression in the late Imperial and early Soviet periods; in the regime's focus not just on former ""oppositionists,"" wreckers and saboteurs, but also on crime and social disorder; and in the common European concern to identify and isolate ""undesirable"" elements. Recent studies have examined in much greater depth and detail the precipitants and triggers that turned a determination to protect the Revolution into a ferocious mass repression.The Anatomy of Terror is an edited volume which brings together the work of the leading historians in the field, presenting not only the latest developments in the subject, but also the latest evolution of the debate. The sixteen chapters are divided into eight themes, with some themes reflecting the diversity of sources, methodologies and angles of approach, others showing stark differences of opinion.

Yet, its geographical reach has remained largely limited to the West or Western cases. We still know relatively little about intelligence services and their roles in the making of postcolonial nation-states in Africa or Asia, much less their perceptions of the world outside.

1436,Agents of Influence: Britain's Secret Intelligence War Against the IRA,Book,,"Recruited by British Intelligence to infiltrate the IRA and Sinn Féin during the height of the Northern Ireland Troubles, they were ‘agents of influence’. With codenames like INFLICTION, STAKEKNIFE, 3007 and CAROL, these spies played a pivotal role in the fight against Irish republicanism. Now, for the first time, some of these agents have emerged from the shadows to tell their compelling stories. Agents of Influence takes you behind the scenes of the secret intelligence war which helped bring the IRA’s armed struggle to an end.  Historian Aaron Edwards, the critically acclaimed author of UVF: Behind the Mask, explains how the IRA was penetrated by British agents, with explosive new revelations about the hidden agendas of prominent republicans like Martin McGuinness and Freddie Scappaticci and lesser-known ones like Joe Haughey and John Joe Magee. Bringing to light recently declassified TOP SECRET documents and the first-hand testimonies of agents and their handlers, Edwards reveals how British Intelligence gained extraordinary access to the IRA’s inner circle and manipulated them into engaging with the peace process.  With new insights into the spy masters behind the scenes, their strategies and tactics, and operations in Europe, the United States and beyond, Agents of Influence offers a rare and shocking glimpse into betrayal at the heart of Irish republicanism during the vicious decades of the Troubles.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WK3WY2SM,2021,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Aaron', 'lastName': 'Edwards'}]",Merrion Press,,author,Aaron,Edwards,

In 1996 the British Security Service (MI5) foiled an attack by the IRA aimed at causing a total electrical blackout of the greater London area, a plan that would have seen major disruption in the capital for many weeks or months. Using recently declassified material this paper seeks to re-evaluate the impact of these IRA infrastructural sabotage campaigns that have until now either been ignored or judged to have been derisory or incongruous failures.

1443,"Strategy, intelligence, and British performance during the 1956 Suez Crisis",Thesis,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&uin=uk.bl.ethos.590114,"Strategy and intelligence are words that enjoy heavy deployment in contemporary studies into
war and warfare. They are held as critically important to the successful pursuit of policy and
war and they are also held as critically important to each other; strategy functions better with
positive intellgence support, and intelligence cannot function at all without the direction of
strategy. Despite this obvious importance however, the relationship between strategy and
intelligence remains under-explored, as neither Strategic Studies nor lntelligence Studies
have sought to codify that relationship. lnstead those two sub-fields have been subject to
""drivers"" that have propelled the forward focus of those areas, drivers which have been
focused on the empirical demand of the day. This thesis seeks to explore this gap and
identify, codify, and operationalise the relationship between strategy and intelligence, before
testing this model against a single case study, British performance during the 1956 Suez
crisis, in order to observe the real world working and reveal broader insight into the
relationship in practice.
The relationship will be shown to be an inherently political activity that is also extremely
dynamic as well as covering entire governmental machineries. That relationship is not perfect
however, and the roles played by assumptions are a consideration of particular importance
that carry significant consequences in reality. That reality in the fonn of the British
experience during the 1956 Suez Crisis serves to reveal that although there is a model to
explain and perhaps even imply a harmonious functioning of the relationship, the reality
instead shows significant impediments to the smooth functioning of this relationship. By
creating this model and then testing it against the real world practice of strategy and
intelligence, it is intended to reveal that strategy and intelligence share a special but very
fragile relationship in practice.

This assertion is examined here by looking into another case in which Israel was also militarily surprised. In February 1960 the Egyptian Army deployed offensively along the joint border, while the IDF remained unaware of the situation.

The article ventures to separate the apologetics and (flawed) memories from the information provided by the now available documentary evidence. After presenting the prevailing Israeli version, the article analyses the memoirs on the Egyptian side about the preparations for war and determining D-Day, to refute this version. Based on the contemporary protocols of government and general staff meetings and political-military consultations, it argues that the Israeli government, general staff and intelligence community did not regard at the time the outbreak of war as an imminent threat. The steps they took concerned the medium and long run, and were irrelevant in the short run. Similarly, the mobilization of reserves was not connected to the alarm of war but to the Day of Independence parade in Jerusalem. The article claims on the basis of these protocols that the reason for the excitement was the collapse of the Israeli intelligence’s conception that Egypt would not resume hostilities before it could hit at the interior of Israel, and Syria would not go to war without Egypt. The arrival of Libyan Mirages and Iraqi Hunters to Egypt in April fulfilled this condition and the possibility of war could not be dismissed offhand. Israel responded to the new situation by the book. It shared the information and analysis with the White House and the CIA; it refreshed the IDF planning down to the divisional level and the IDF general staff held a series of thorough discussions to estimate the situation. The bottom line of this process was a government directive to the IDF to prepare for war at the end of the summer of 1973 (as it actually happened). In the latter portion of the article I explain why this directive was ignored when it was put to test in late September and early October of 1973.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5BEI343X,"August 1, 2013","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Yoav', 'lastName': 'Gelber'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Yoav,Gelber,

Instead, AMAN covers the majority of intelligence activity arenas, including intelligence regarding state-related issues. This field of activity presents a situation where AMAN's officers, and predominantly, its research division, are compelled to deal with sensitive issues embedded well within Israeli political and public controversy. This is commonly illustrated in the field of ‘Intelligence for Peace’ in general and more specifically in the Palestinian arena. Intelligence research surrounding the question of Palestinian commitment to peace throughout the Oslo Process and following the onset of the al Aqsa Intifada – activity classified as ‘Intelligence on Intentions’ – placed AMAM at the heart of political debate in Israel and resulted in bitter internal disagreements in AMAN as well as tensions between the intelligence service and the political leadership. Throughout the years, numerous recommendations have been repeatedly voiced to end AMAN's monopoly over Israel's national intelligence assessment (including aspects of intelligence regarding state-related issues). These recommendations were based predominantly on hindsight evaluations, such as AMAN's repeated failures in intelligence assessments. This paper calls for gradual termination of AMAN's activity of intelligence regarding state-related issues, in light of its contradiction with the appropriate military–political separation in a democratic society.

The thesis shows that our understanding of the Cold War as a binary rivalry between the two blocs is too simple an approach and obscures important characteristics of intelligence cooperation among allies. To reveal a more comprehensive analysis of intelligence cooperation, this thesis develops our understanding of it more broadly, by developing a model called ‘intelligence diplomacy’. This model explores a vital, if little understood, aspect of contemporary international relations given the prevalence of transnational threats today. Intelligence diplomacy involves negotiations and the exploitation of different aspects of joint intelligence activities, synchronized between diplomats and specialized intelligence officers. While such efforts often result in overlap between diplomats and intelligence liaison efforts, there is strong evidence that the acts of intelligence services vary from the instructions of their foreign ministries. The thesis also shows that a pragmatic approach offers states new opportunities to protect national interests, by conducting intelligence diplomacy to influence crucial areas such as nuclear weapons and to exploit cooperation in support of their own strategic imperatives. By doing so this thesis not only reveals previously-unexplored origins of secret intelligence cooperation between Turkey and the West, but also contributes to wider academic debates on the nature of the Cold War by highlighting the potential agency of weaker states in the Western Alliance.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q8TGVRAX,2017,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Egemen B.', 'lastName': 'Bezci'}]",,,author,Egemen B.,Bezci,

It prompted substantial intelligence cooperation amongst Western countries. Their liaison included not only the collection of human intelligence (Humint) but also an effort to protect six Americans who had escaped becoming hostages, and then a successful covert exfiltration operation to secure their escape from Iran. Canadian embassy staff, assisted by CIA experts, mounted this operation in late January 1980. We use the Iranian Revolution and occupation of the American embassy in Tehran both to flesh out the nature of contemporary Western Humint cooperation and to highlight the intelligence activities, including international intelligence liaison, of Western foreign ministries.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NBG4RM65,"October 1, 2012","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Don', 'lastName': 'Munton'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Miriam', 'lastName': 'Matejova'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Don,Munton,

The US intelligence community, however, was suspicious of the message and the messenger, dismissing Soviet ‘war talk’ as disinformation. Some officials even believed that the British had tweaked their reports to influence US policy. President Ronald Reagan, however, on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, listened to Gordievsky rather than his intelligence advisors. The war scare had a profound influence on Reagan's thinking about nuclear war, Kremlin fears, and Soviet–American relations that led him to seek a new détente with Moscow and the end of the Cold War through diplomacy rather than confrontation. Subsequent events and post-Cold War revelations vindicated Gordievsky.

Nevertheless, the Open Government initiative in the UK and the Clinton Executive Order of 1995 have resulted in some disclosures, often from consumer agencies who were in receipt of intelligence material. There have also been limited releases from other countries. Against that background, this essay considers two questions: First, how far has the study of intelligence affected the broad context of Cold War history during the last decade? And second, how effective have we been in probing the institutional history of secret services during the Cold War?

It will be argued that the successes or failures of each of these men in command were directly linked to their understanding of the importance of gathering and using intelligence in the field. For Wolseley and Wood, their ability to lead men to victory in battle, operate in harsh environments and adapt their operations with the intelligence they received resulted in the 1870s being a springboard for future fame and glory. For Chelmsford, his disdain for intelligence, and the enemy, was to result in infamy when troops under his command suffered the most comprehensive defeat the British army was ever to experience at the hands of an African colonial foe.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MN83B4NN,"October 1, 2007","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Stephen', 'lastName': 'Manning'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Stephen,Manning,

Intelligence played a major role in the conflict, as acknowledged by both sides and by many international observers at the time. Russian commentators attributed many of Russia's military and political reverses in the conflict both to their own military intelligence failures and to the sophistication (and broad-ranging scope) of Japanese intelligence activities. As a result, in the wake of the conflict, Russia set out to reorganize her whole intelligence structure via deep and broad-ranging reform, initiating developments that would ultimately culminate in the Soviet Union becoming one of the premier‘panoptic’ surveillance states of the twentieth century in terms of the measures it took to guard against both internal and external ‘hidden forces’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/S8763KDD,"October 1, 2007","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Alex', 'lastName': 'Marshall'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Alex,Marshall,

Marder established what became the orthodox view of the development of the British navy in the years leading up to the First World War.1 Building upon the work of Sir Llewellyn Woodward, who argues that, from the outset of the twentieth century, British naval policy was framed as a response to the threat posed by the rising German naval power,2 Marder makes precise claims about the nature of the response. In particular, he states that, under the leadership of the first sea lord from 1904 to 1910, Admiral Sir John Fisher, the admiralty undertook two root-and-branch reforms. First, it redeployed Britain's fleets and squadrons, reducing the number of foreign stations, scrapping obsolescent vessels, and stationing the most powerful units of the fleet in European waters. Next, at Fisher's prompting, it triggered a naval revolution by ordering the building of a new type of warship, HMS Dreadnought, the world's first turbine-powered, all-big-gun battleship. In both cases, Marder is unambiguous about the motive: the redeployment adjusted Britain's force posture to ensure a preponderance of strength in the vicinity of the North Sea, the theatre in which the expected war with Germany would be fought. The new type of ship was necessary to help to modernize the navy's matériel in keeping with advances in gunnery, propulsion, and torpedoes. If not explicitly aimed at Germany, the new ship would ensure that the navy was better prepared for a war that Fisher perceived to be ‘inevitable’s.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/D6JSYJVX,"June 1, 2008","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Matthew S.', 'lastName': 'Seligmann'}]",,The International History Review,author,Matthew S.,Seligmann,

Despite the introduction in the 1880s of high explosive shells, intensive construction continued until the eve of war. Fortifications figured prominently in armaments budgets and in offensive as well as defensive strategic planning, while their design changed radically. Nonetheless, the pattern of development worked against the Central Powers. Austria-Hungary concentrated against Italy at the expense of the Balkans and Galicia; Germany concentrated on Alsace-Lorraine, neglecting the east until 1912.

These plans were apparently much in vogue during Admiral Sir John Fisher's first term as first sea lord. Recent interpretations have also argued that Fisher never seriously considered amphibious projects over an economic strategy. This article will demonstrate that amphibious plans were central to the royal navy's strategy against Germany but were limited to supporting a North Sea/Baltic observational blockade.

Rather than waiting for this to happen, the tsarist regime chose to go to war.

The Cold War, however, turned terrorism into a global televised drama personified by “the Bin Laden of the Cold War” and “enemy number one”- Carlos the Jackal. Who was this tall man in a black beret, thick glasses, and a smirk on his face? How was the Carlos myth created, was he really that prolific and ‘successful’ and how do you get rid of such a hothead, politely? In this episode we look at why the US was sure the East was runninga worldwide terrorism network and we explore whether all Eastern bloc countries were best friends with Carlos the Jackal. 
This is a story of guns, kidnappings and murders but also a story of a small Eastern bloc country pulling a daring trick on the Cold War’s most feared terrorist.

Research infrastructure has been created with journals and conferences. The article explores how a European School of Intelligence Studies (ESIS) differs from the traditional British and American research and which scholars constitute ESIS. This work also presents new methodical proposals (e.g. using a quantitative method for selecting material from the existing empirical data sets), following the requirement that intelligence studies should have an interdisciplinary nature. Our argumentation is based on an analysis of the two main conferences, the conference of the International Intelligence History Association (IIHA) and the Need to Know-format (NtK), and it defines the content of the ESIS based on state of the art. European researchers participating in these fora were primary from Germany, Benelux, the Nordic states, and Central- and Eastern Europe. ESIS shows European West-East unity and strong ties to British, American and Israeli research, it also indicates a North-South divide. The Archival Revolution has been defining for the development of the ESIS. The access to documents regarding all areas of intelligence activity, including operational records and personal files of agents, differs from traditional declassification. This way, it is possible in Europe to do empirical research on intelligence operations in a hitherto unseen scale. Furthermore, the ESIS is characterized by substantial interest to counterintelligence and awareness of the differences between intelligence in democracies and authoritarian regimes.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YGE9BL3X,"September 1, 2020","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Władysław', 'lastName': 'Bułhak'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Thomas Wegener', 'lastName': 'Friis'}]",,"The International Journal of Intelligence, Security, and Public Affairs",author,Władysław,Bułhak,

At a time of acute political crisis, the partisan interests of the legislators who sit on oversight bodies may override their other responsibilities. This can result in distorted and misleading investigations and reports. This hypothesis is examined against the evidence of precisely such a mode of failure in both the British and American legislative inquiries into intelligence on Iraqi ‘weapons of mass destruction’. The authors conclude that any effective oversight must include a range of parallel legislative, judicial, executive and independent mechanisms to try and minimize the inherent weaknesses in each oversight model.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HSES4KGA,"October 1, 2006","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Anthony', 'lastName': 'Glees'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Philip H.

Academics and the public at large therefore to this very day face great difficulties in answering two specific questions: What covert action has the CIA carried out in Europe during its almost 60 years of existence?

Among them are the clandestine anti-communist stay-behind networks set up by the CIA in case of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. As the details of the operation emerge only gradually some sources suggest that the stay-behind network was linked to terrorist groups, adding further interest to this largely unknown research subject at a time when the so called ‘war on terrorism’ has forced academics to examine present and historical terrorism data once again.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FNAA93SF,"October 1, 2006","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Daniele', 'lastName': 'Ganser'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Daniele,Ganser,

In this reflection, the Committee's Chief Counsel states that by examining the full record over time, the Committee found that it was insufficient to blame abuses solely on intelligence agencies.

It argues that Ludlum and the makers of the film version of The Bourne Identity incorporated a variety of aspects of reality into their plotlines. Some of these aspects are not entirely factual, while others stick very closely to the truth. Congressional oversight, ethical dilemmas tied to assassination and real-life antagonists play significant roles in both the novel and the film. In the book the antagonists are terrorists, particularly Carlos the Jackal, but in the movie version the ‘bad people’ are CIA officials. Although the antagonist changes between the novel and the film, they both are realistic aspects that draw the audience in. Not only do these three aspects of reality contribute to the plots of the novel and the film, but they also make the audience reflect on issues brought up in the film.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VP7HA7K2,"February 1, 2008","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Shannon Mollie', 'lastName': 'Epps'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Shannon Mollie,Epps,

Drawing from a letter written to the first writer who ever used a spy as a central character, indeed, a hero, this paper suggests that such a transformation is made easier when, among other things, well-meaning people present obstacles to the spy's work – people who meddle in the business of spying. The paper concludes, after a survey of several contemporary writers, that they have done so by turning Congress into the meddler.

Robert P. Hanssen, the FBI agent who spied first for the Soviet Union and then for Russia for more than two decades, defies logic. His outward persona contradicted his real self more than one can imagine. In Lives of Others, the paper submits that the reality of the totalitarian existence in East Germany was also almost impossible to imagine. But both of these films do a creditable job in trying to make the unimaginable seem possible. Moreover, the paper argues that the famous ‘outing’ of CIA undercover officer, Valerie Plame, has all of the material for good cinema, but that the failure to prosecute those who violated the law by revealing her true position is what is unimaginable in that case.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QG9QW9U4,"February 1, 2008","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Frederick P.', 'lastName': 'Hitz'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Frederick P.,Hitz,

He reflects back on how his work has been influenced by his first career as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency during the 1950s. After leaving the CIA, he wrote about his experiences in the world of espionage (sans anything classified) while operating in deep cover and engaging in covert action in, as he recalls, ‘some of the world's most godforsaken places’.

Robert DeNiro's recent film, The Good Shepherd, fails on both counts while purporting to be ‘the untold story’ of the CIA's early years. This article argues that there is no need for Hollywood to concoct fiction about intelligence and call it history, because the real stories should be compelling enough. One of the great true stories from this period is the saga of John Downey and Richard Fecteau, CIA officers captured in China in 1952 and held for two decades. But because the reality of their riveting experience does not square with Hollywood's agenda about the CIA and intelligence, it is doubtful that an accurate movie about them will ever make the silver screen.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GW6XGWCZ,"February 1, 2008","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Nicholas', 'lastName': 'Dujmovic'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Nicholas,Dujmovic,

They both star Robert Redford and both portray the Central Intelligence Agency as a wicked organization. In light of Hollywood's distorted depiction of the CIA in these movies, their contribution to the health and well-being of the American polity – which depends, like all democracies, on the presence of an informed citizenry – is questionable. As with the best written scholarship on the subject of intelligence, film-goers deserve to know accurately not only what is bad but what is good within the shadows of America's dark side of government, and how the bad might be redressed.

Some have taken the approach of ‘ostriches’, content to bury their heads in the sand and continue the earlier era of trust when members of Congress deferred to the decisions of the executive branch within the domains of intelligence. Others – indeed, a majority – have chosen to become unalloyed boosters for intelligence –‘ cheerleaders’ who view their job primarily as one of explaining the value of intelligence to the American people and supporting intelligence missions with robust funding and encouragement. Taking the opposite approach, another set of lawmakers – the ‘lemon-suckers’ – have consistently found fault with America's attempts to spy on adversaries or overthrow regimes that fail to accommodate US interests. Finally, some lawmakers have been ‘guardians’, striking a balance between serving as partners of the intelligence agencies on Capitol Hill and, through a persistent examination of budgets and operations, demanding competence and law-abiding behavior from these agencies.

The literature largely presents intelligence ethics as a two-sided debate between teleologists and deontologists. I propose that ethical justifications should instead be considered along a progressive spectrum drawn from the work of moral psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg.

Once the work of an insular and carefully select few, intelligence production is now a networked, partially open and extensively public–private enterprise. Most poignantly, new practices of public–private ‘collection’ face Western intelligence services with novel questions about control and accountability – questions to which the services have responded with hopes that by standardizing ‘methodologies’, central command may be retained. Suggesting a more complex picture, this article argues that ‘managing uncertainty’ imply forms of interpretation and choices which cannot be pre-empted by rule-regulation: more than Weber’s ideal of the procedural and rule-bound, it may be his (once central, yet largely marginalized) emphasis on institutional and individual capacities for critical ‘judgment’ that is of relevance today.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9VZQUJEQ,"January 2, 2018","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Karen Lund', 'lastName': 'Petersen'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Vibeke Schou', 'lastName': 'Tjalve'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Karen Lund,Petersen,

We argue that Bond is important because, rightly or wrongly, and not without inaccuracy, it has filled a public knowledge vacuum about intelligence agencies and security threats. On another level, this article explores the unexpected yet important interactions between Bond and the actual world of intelligence. We contend that the orthodoxy dictating that Bond and spying are diametric opposites—one is the stuff of fantasy, the other is reality—is problematic, for the worlds of Bond and real intelligence collide, overlap and intermesh in fascinating and significant ways. In short, Bond is important for scholars because he is an international cultural icon that continues to operate at the borders of fiction and reality, framing and constructing not only public perceptions but also to some degree intelligence practices. Core narratives of intelligence among not only the public but also policymakers and intelligence officers are imagined, sustained, deepened, produced and reproduced through and by Bond. We conclude that Bond and intelligence should be thought of as co-constitutive; the series shapes representations and perceptions of intelligence, but it also performs a productive role, influencing the behaviours of intelligence agencies themselves.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WJ242IFJ,"September 19, 2018","[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Trevor', 'lastName': 'McCrisken'}, {'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Christopher', 'lastName': 'Moran'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Trevor,McCrisken,

As a result, intelligence budgets have recovered after the post-Cold War peace dividend and were anyway being restored to deal with humanitarian and peacekeeping operations. Intelligence is now involved in fighting a war rather than in preventing one; while it is more secret than ever, it is also more international, which makes the ethical question of ""spying on friends"" a sharper problem than ever.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZBSZI5XA,2004,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Michael', 'lastName': 'Herman'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Michael,Herman,

The international nature of jihadist terrorism is placing increasing demands on intelligence agencies to cooperate with new partners overseas and to extend their range of methods, human and technical, to acquire such intelligence. This pressure is creating ethical dilemmas for the agencies at a time when the methods of secret intelligence and their impact on individual rights are the subject of public controversy.

Both professions are in the business of information acquisition. Spies, though, work for the government, while the allegiance of most scholars is to independent research and teaching. Moreover, spy organizations view students as potential hires; in contrast, scholars are likely to see students as young charges placed in their hands to educate and prepare for lives of consequence. One school of thought argues that, since spies and scholars are both citizens, they should work together in partnership: sharing knowledge to improve the intelligence product, training and recruiting students, warning of radical activities on campus. A second school counters that the university is meant to be a pure and open place, dedicated to unbiased learning and free of government ties – especially entanglements with secret agencies.

1670,Beyond the vigilant state: globalisation and intelligence,Journal article,,"Abstract The world of intelligence has grown exponentially over the last decade. This article suggests that prevailing explanation of this expansion – the spectre of ‘new terrorism’ – reflects serious misunderstandings. Much of the emergency legislation which has extended the power of the state so remarkably was already sitting in the pending trays of officials in the late 1990s. Instead, the rise of both the ‘new terrorism’ and its supposed nemesis – the secret state – both owe more to long-term structural factors. Globalisation has accelerated a wide range of sub-military transnational threats, of which the ‘new terrorism’ is but one example. Meanwhile the long-promised engines of global governance are nowhere in sight. In their absence, the underside of a globalising world is increasingly policed by ‘vigilant states’ that resort to a mixture of military power and intelligence power in an attempt to address these problems. Yet the intelligence services cannot meet the improbable demands for omniscience made by governments, nor can they square their new enforcer role with vocal demands by global civil society for improved ethical practice.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NT6G8JYJ,2009,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Richard J.', 'lastName': 'Aldrich'}]",,Review of International Studies,author,Richard J.,Aldrich,

1732,Spy Watching: Intelligence Accountability in the United States,Book,,"All democracies have had to contend with the challenge of tolerating hidden spy services within otherwise relatively transparent governments. Democracies pride themselves on privacy and liberty, but intelligence organizations have secret budgets, gather information surreptitiously around the world, and plan covert action against foreign regimes. Sometimes, they have even targeted the very citizens they were established to protect, as with the COINTELPRO operations in the 1960s and 1970s, carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against civil rights and antiwar activists. In this sense, democracy and intelligence have always been a poor match. Yet Americans live in an uncertain and threatening world filled with nuclear warheads, chemical and biological weapons, and terrorists intent on destruction. Without an intelligence apparatus scanning the globe to alert the United States to these threats, the planet would be an even more perilous place.  In Spy Watching, Loch K. Johnson explores the United States' travails in its efforts to maintain effective accountability over its spy services. Johnson explores the work of the famous Church Committee, a Senate panel that investigated America's espionage organizations in 1975 and established new protocol for supervising the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the nation's other sixteen secret services. Johnson explores why partisanship has crept into once-neutral intelligence operations, the effect of the 9/11 attacks on the expansion of spying, and the controversies related to CIA rendition and torture programs. He also discusses both the Edward Snowden case and the ongoing investigations into the Russian hack of the 2016 US election. Above all, Spy Watching seeks to find a sensible balance between the twin imperatives in a democracy of liberty and security. Johnson draws on scores of interviews with Directors of Central Intelligence and others in America's secret agencies, making this a uniquely authoritative account.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BN9FKPQ4,2018,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Loch K.', 'lastName': 'Johnson'}]",Oxford University Press,,author,Loch K.,Johnson,

1736,The ethics of whistleblowing: Creating a new limit on intelligence activity,Journal article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1755088217712069,"One of the biggest challenges facing modern societies is how to monitor one’s intelligence community while maintaining the necessary level of secrecy. Indeed, while some secrecy is needed for mission success, too much has allowed significant abuse. Moreover, extending this secrecy to democratic oversight actors only creates another layer of unobserved actors and removes the public scrutiny that keeps their power and decision-making in check. This article will therefore argue for a new type of oversight through a specialised ethical whistleblowing framework. This includes, first, outlining what intelligence wrongdoings justify whistleblowing; second, whether whistleblowing is the correct remedy – something not necessarily clear with intelligence; and finally, what form the whistleblowing should take. This framework will examine the Snowden case to determine whether he was correct leaking intelligence data and whether the means were appropriate, and second, whether those involved...",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YCUZ9AAT,2018,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Ross W.', 'lastName': 'Bellaby'}]",,Journal of International Political Theory,author,Ross W.,Bellaby,

Recently, they have been bolstered by allegations of prisoner abuse that some have linked to intelligence organisations. Such demands for judgement are articulated with equal measures of urgency and apprehension: there is a perceived need to make clear statements about what constitutes morally prohibited and permissible conduct with regard to intelligence gathering, and yet the tools with which one might perform such a task are not readily apparent. This article begins with three basic assumptions. First, intelligence collection does not exist in an amoral realm of necessity, but, rather, is a human endeavour involving choice and deliberation and, therefore, is vulnerable to ethical scrutiny.

The concept of the intelligence cycle has been central to the study of intelligence. As Intelligence Studies has established itself as a distinctive branch of Political Science, it has generated its own foundational literature, within which the intelligence cycle has constituted a vital thread - one running through all social-science approaches to the study of intelligence and constituting a staple of professional training courses. However, there is a growing acceptance that the concept neither accurately reflects the intelligence process nor accommodates important elements of it, such as covert action, counter-intelligence and oversight. Bringing together key authors in the field, the book considers these questions across a number of contexts: in relation to intelligence as a general concept, military intelligence, corporate/private sector intelligence and policing and criminal intelligence. A number of the contributions also go beyond discussion of the limitations of the cycle concept to propose alternative conceptualisations of the intelligence process. What emerges is a plurality of approaches that seek to advance the debate and, as a consequence, Intelligence Studies itself. This book will be of great interest to students of intelligence studies, strategic studies, criminology and policing, security studies and IR in general, as well as to practitioners in the field.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Y25L9DVK,2013,"[{'creatorType': 'editor', 'firstName': 'Mark', 'lastName': 'Phythian'}]",Taylor and Francis,,editor,Mark,Phythian,

1744,Introduction to Intelligence Studies,Book,,"Since the attacks of 9/11, the United States Intelligence Community (IC) has undergone an extensive overhaul. Perhaps the greatest of these changes has been the formation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. As a cabinet-level official, the Director oversees the various agencies of the IC and reports directly to the President. The IC today faces challenges as it never has before; everything from terrorism to pandemics to economic stability has now become an intelligence issue. As a result, the IC is shifting its focus to a world in which tech-savvy domestic and international terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, failing states, and economic instability are now a way of life.  Introduction to Intelligence Studies provides a comprehensive overview of intelligence and security issues, defining critical terms, and reviewing the history of intelligence as practiced in the United States. Designed in a practical sequence, the book begins with the basics of intelligence, progresses through its history, describes best practices, and explores the way the IC looks and operates today. Each chapter begins with objectives and key terms and closes with questions to test reader assimilation.  The authors examine the ""pillars"" of the American intelligence system―collection, analysis, counterintelligence, and covert operations―and demonstrate how these work together to provide ""decision advantage."" The book provides equal treatment to the functions of the intelligence world―balancing coverage on intelligence collection, counterintelligence, information management, critical thinking, and decision-making. It also covers such vital issues as laws and ethics, writing and briefing for the IC, and the emerging threats and challenges that intelligence professionals will face in the future.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FPVB2HT2,2012,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Carl J.

Intelligence gathering can be viewed as a general process whether involving national security, business intelligence, consumer behaviour or families. Goffman suggests concepts applicable across a variety of settings, although his primary concern is with face-to-face interaction. Recent developments in surveillance and communication also give the study of remote interaction increased salience. There is need for concepts that include the distance-mediated forms of observation and interaction associated with new technological forms such as video and computer surveillance. I seek an empirical, analytic and moral ecology (or geography or mapping) of surveillance. Of particular interest are data which are involuntarily collected and recorded from individuals, whether through intrusive and invasive methods (prying out what is normally withheld) or using technology to give meaning to what the individual offers (for example, appearance, emissions unrecognised by the unaided senses, or behaviour which traditionally was ignored and unrecorded). As part of a broader inquiry, I analyse five aspects of surveillance as empirical and behavioural phenomena: the characteristics of the means themselves; the content or the kind of data gathered; the structures of the setting in which the surveillance is used; the application of the means and the goals sought. The paper emphasises the first two. Identifying such factors are an initial step in setting research agendas and in explanation, evaluation and the creation of policies sensitive to the richness of the empirical world.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/L5RJDBMY,2004,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Gary', 'lastName': 'Marx'}]",,Intelligence and National Security,author,Gary,Marx,

Drawing on recently declassified documents, unpublished correspondence and exclusive interviews with key officials and journalists, Christopher Moran pays particular attention to the ways that the press and memoirs have been managed by politicians and spies. He argues that, by the 1960s, governments had become so concerned with their inability to keep secrets that they increasingly sought to offset damaging leaks with their own micro-managed publications. The book reveals new insights into seminal episodes in British post-war history, including the Suez crisis, the D-Notice Affair and the treachery of the Cambridge spies, identifying a new era of offensive information management, and putting the contemporary battle between secret-keepers, electronic media and digital whistle-blowers into long-term perspective.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IQXESL6Y,2012,"[{'creatorType': 'author', 'firstName': 'Christopher', 'lastName': 'Moran'}]",Cambridge University Press,,author,Christopher,Moran,

If the business is intelligence, however, we search in vain. As historian Walter Laqueur warned us, so far no one has succeeded in crafting a theory of intelligence. I have to wonder if the difficult) in doing so resides more in the slipperiness of the tools than in the poor skills of the craftsmen or the complexity of the topic. Indeed, even today, we have no accepted definition of intelligence. The term is defined anew by each author who addresses it, and these definitions rarely refer to one another or build off what has been written before. Without a clear idea of what intelligence is, how can we develop a theory to explain how it works? If you cannot define a term of art, then you need to rethink something. In some way you are not getting to the heart of the matter. Here is an opportunity: a compelling definition of intelligence might help us to devise a theory of intelligence and increase our understanding. In the hope of advancing discussions of this topic, I have collected some of the concise definitions of intelligence that I deem to be distinguished either by their source or by their clarity.
